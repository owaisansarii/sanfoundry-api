As Suspension particles will ideally form a layered cake over the filter aid cake layer. The high porosity of the filter aid layer will ensure a high filtration rate. Porosity is not determined by pore size alone. High porosity is still possible with small size pores.\nAnd at high pH and low pI the proteins will not denature and not coagulate and therefore more aggregates will not be formed so there will be less filtration rate."

        "Answer": "Answer: b\nExplanation: Centrifuge is any device that applies a sustained centrifugal force; that is, a force due to rotation. Effectively, the centrifuge substitutes a similar, stronger, force for that of gravity.\nWhen a suspension is rotated at a certain speed or revolutions per minute (RPM), centrifugal force causes the particles to move radially away from the axis of rotation. The force on the particles (compared to gravity) is called Relative Centrifugal Force (RCF). For example, an RCF of 500 x g indicates that the centrifugal force is 500 times greater than earthly gravitational force."

        "Answer": "Answer: b\nExplanation: As the feed rate is increased the liquid layer moving up the wall of the centrifuge becomes thicker; this reduces the performance of the centrifuge by increasing the distance a particle must travel to reach the wall. Liquid from the feed spills over a weir at the top of the bowl. When the thickness of sediment collecting in the bowl reaches the position of the liquid-overflow weir, separation efficiency declines rapidly. This limits the capacity of the centrifuge. "

Particles of different densities or sizes in a suspension will sediment at different rates, with the larger and denser particles sedimenting faster. These sedimentation rates can be increased by using centrifugal force. A suspension of cells subjected to a series of increasing centrifugal force cycles will yield a series of pellets containing cells of decreasing sedimentation rate.\nDifferential centrifugation is a common procedure in microbiology and cytology used to separate certain organelles from whole cells for further analysis of specific parts of cells.

Desorption is the opposite – when something is not attracted to the substance. How it relates to chromatography is through the mobile and stationary phase. Depending on what the substance adsorbs or desorbs to, will determine how it will move in the chromatogram. For example, if it adsorbs to the mobile phase, it will move a lot. However, if it adsorbs to the stationary phase, it will not move very much. This is how mixtures are separated through chromatography, as different substances in the mixture will adsorb and desorb differently, and hence will move differently, and thus separation is achieved."

There are many types of non-Newtonian fluids, as they are defined to be something that fails to obey a particular property – for example, most fluids with long molecular chains can react in a non-Newtonian manner."

A slightly less rigorous definition is that the drag of a small object being moved slowly through the fluid is proportional to the force applied to the object. (Compare friction). Important fluids, like water as well as most gases, behave – to good approximation – as a Newtonian fluid under normal conditions on Earth."

        "Answer": "Answer: b\nExplanation: Simple circular flow of liquid around the shaft is generally disadvantageous and should be avoided. In circular flow, liquid moves in a streamline fashion and there is little mixing between fluid at different heights in the tank. Circular flow also leads to vortex development. At high impeller speeds, the vortex may reach down to the impeller so that gas from the surrounding atmosphere is drawn into the liquid; this is generally undesirable as it produces very high mechanical stresses in the stirrer shaft, bearings and seal. Prevention of circular flow has a high priority in design of mixing systems, and is usually achieved by installing baffles which interrupt the circular flow pattern and create turbulence in the fluid."

The turbulent regime is fully developed at Rei > 103 or 104 for most small impellers in baffled vessels. For the same impellers in vessels without baffles, the power curves are somewhat different, Without baffles, turbulence is not fully developed until Rei > 105; even then the value of Np’ is reduced to between 1/2 and 1/10 that with baffles.

        "Answer": "Answer: a\nExplanation: The laminar region extends to higher Reynolds numbers in pseudoplastic fluids than in Newtonian systems. At Rei below 10 and above 200 the results for Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids are essentially the same; in the intermediate range, pseudoplastic liquids consume less power than Newtonian fluids. Flow patterns in pseudoplastic and Newtonian fluids differ significantly. Even when there is high turbulence near the impeller in pseudoplastic systems, the bulk liquid may be moving very slowly and consuming relatively little power. "

The presence of bubbles also affects the hydrodynamic behaviour of fluid around the impeller. Large gas-filled cavities develop behind the stirrer blades in aerated liquids; these cavities reduce the resistance to fluid flow and decrease the drag coefficient of the impeller. With sparging, the power consumed could be reduced to as little as half the ungassed value, depending on gas flow rate. "

To overcome this problem, we must consider the processes in the system which are linked to mass transfer of A. Transport of A is linked to reaction at the surface of the solid, so that the value of CAi will depend on the rate of consumption of A at the interface. In practical terms, we can therefore calculate the rate of mass transfer of A only if we have information about the rate of reaction at the solid surface. Simultaneous reaction and mass transfer occurs in many bioprocesses."

        "Answer": "Answer: a\nExplanation: Normally, it can be assumed that there is negligible resistance to mass transfer at the actual interface, i.e. within distances corresponding to molecular free paths on either side of the phase boundary. This is equivalent to assuming that the phases are in equilibrium at the interface; therefore, CA1i and CA2i are equilibrium concentrations. As a result it is known that there are special situations, such as when there is adsorption of material at the interface, where the assumption is invalid. However, in ordinary situations, the evidence is that equilibrium does exist at the interface between phases. If the bulk liquids were in equilibrium, no net mass transfer would take place."

        "Answer": "Answer: a\nExplanation: kL in fermentation liquids is about 3-4×10-4 m s-1 for bubbles greater than 2-3 mm diameter; this can be reduced to 1×10-4m s-1 for smaller bubbles depending on bubble rigidity. Once the bubbles are above 2-3 mm in size, kL is relatively constant and insensitive to conditions."

            "d) Leakage of the Broth"
        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: a\nExplanation: The most important property of air bubbles in fermenters is their size. Small bubbles have correspondingly slow bubble-rise velocities; consequently they stay in the liquid longer, allowing more time for the oxygen to dissolve. While it is desirable to have small bubbles, there are practical limits. Bubbles << 1 mm diameter can become a nuisance in bioreactors. Oxygen concentration in these bubbles equilibrates with that in the medium within seconds, so that the gas hold-up no longer reflects the capacity of the system for mass transfer."

        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: b\nExplanation: Coalescence of small bubbles into bigger bubbles is generally undesirable because it reduces the total interfacial area and gas hold-up. Frequency of coalescence depends mainly on the liquid properties. In a coalescing liquid, a large fraction of bubble collisions results in the formation of bigger bubbles, while in non-coalescing liquids colliding bubbles do not coalesce readily. Salts act to suppress coalescence; therefore, fermentation media are usually non-coalescing to some extent depending on com- position. This is an advantage for oxygen mass transfer."

        "Answer": "Answer: c\nExplanation: Impeller flooding is said to occur; this means that the gas-handling capacity of the stirrer is smaller than the amount introduced. Flooding should be avoided because an impeller surrounded by gas no longer contacts the liquid properly, resulting in poor mixing and gas dispersion."

In a typical fermentation medium, oxygen solubility is between 5% and 25% lower than in water as a result of solute effects. In simple systems, with all the components being dissolved, C0 represents the oxygen solubility and linearly decreases with increasing solute concentrations. In complex solutions with multi-phase structure an increase in C0 can be detected. It suggests that C0 consists of two components — one being oxygen solubility, the other being determined by the amount of oxygen adsorbed on the interphase and bound by macromolecules. The presence of biomass leads to a decrease in C0. "

        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: b\nExplanation: In batch fermentation, the demands of the culture vary during the fermentation- at the beginning, the oxygen demand is low but towards the end the demand is high, due to the high biomass and the increased viscosity of the broth. Also, the amount of cooling required will increase during the process, as will the degree of pH control. In a continuous process oxygen demand, cooling requirements and pH control should remain constant. Thus, the use of continuous culture should allow for the easier introduction of process automation."

        "Answer": "Answer: b\nExplanation: Yeast belongs to the class of Protoascomyceten and more specifically to the physiological class of Saccharomyces Cerevisiae. Saccharomyces Cerevisiae is crabtree positive yeast, which is sensitive to high substrate concentrations that results in the reduction of the oxygen uptake rate. As a result glucose is metabolized to ethanol. This metabolic pathway can be reduced by introduction of a regulated feed procedure adapted to the specific growth rate of the yeast."

        "Answer": "Answer: d\nExplanation: The Reynolds number is the ratio of inertial forces to viscous forces and is a convenient parameter for predicting if a flow condition will be laminar or turbulent. It can be interpreted that when the viscous forces are dominant (slow flow, low Re) they are sufficient enough to keep all the fluid particles in line, and then the flow is laminar. Even very low Re indicates viscous creeping motion, where inertia effects are negligible. When the inertial forces dominate over the viscous forces (when the fluid is flowing faster and Re is larger) then the flow is turbulent."

However, limiting the reaction rate by operating at sub-optimum conditions or using an organism or enzyme with low intrinsic activity does not achieve the overall goal of higher conversion rates. Because rA,obs is the reaction rate per volume of catalyst, another way of reducing rA,obs is to reduce the cell or enzyme loading in the solid. This reduces the demand for substrate per particle so that mass transfer has a better chance of supplying it at a sufficient rate. Therefore, if the same mass of cells or enzyme is distributed between more particles, the rate of conversion will increase."

        "Answer": "Answer: c\nExplanation: The sudden widening at the top of the reactor slows the bubble velocity and thus disengages the bubbles from the liquid flow. Carbon-dioxide rich bubbles are thus prevented from entering the downcomer. The increase in area will also helps to stretch bubbles in foams, causing the bubbles to burst. The axial flow circulation caused by the draft tube also helps to reduce foaming."

        "Answer": "Answer: a\nExplanation: In the internal-loop vessels, the riser and down comer are separated by an internal baffle or draft tube; air may be sparged into either the draft tube or the annulus. In the external-loop or outer-loop airlift, separate vertical tubes are connected by short horizontal sections at the top and bottom. Because the riser and downcomer are further apart in external-loop vessels, gas disengagement is more effective than in internal-loop devices. Fewer bubbles are carried into the downcomer, the density difference between fluids in the riser and downcomer is greater, and circulation of liquid in the vessel is faster."

        "Answer": "Answer: b\nExplanation: Many important variables such as biomass concentration and broth composition cannot currently be measured on-line because of the lack of appropriate instruments. Instead, samples must be removed from the reactor and taken to the laboratory for off-line analysis. Because fermentation conditions can change during laboratory analysis, control action based on the measurement is not as effective. Off-line measurements are used in industrial fermentations for analysis of biomass, carbohydrate, protein, phosphate and lipid concentrations, enzyme activity and broth rheology. Samples are usually taken manually every 4-8 h; the results are available 2-24 h later."

For biological processes, specifying the model structure can be difficult because of the complexity of cellular processes and the large number of environmental factors which affect cell culture. Usually, bioprocess models are much-simplified approximate representations deduced from observation rather than from theoretical laws of science. As an example, a frequently-used mathematical model for batch fermentation consists of the Monod equation for growth and an expression for rate of substrate consumption as a function of biomass concentration."

            "d) Decreased levels of proteases"
        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: b\nExplanation: The protein in the inclusion body is misfolded. The misfolded protein has no biological activity and is worthless. If the inclusion bodies are recovered from the culture, the inclusion bodies can be resolubilized and activity restored. When resolubilization is straightforward and recoveries are high, the formation of inclusion bodies can be advantageous, as it simplifies the initial steps of recovery and purification. It is important that during resolubilization the protein be checked by several analytical methods to ensure that no chemical modifications have occurred. Even slight changes in a side group can alter the effectiveness of the product."
