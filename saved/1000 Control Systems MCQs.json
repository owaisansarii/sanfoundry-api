            "d) 1/(1+kp)"
        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: b\nExplanation:  The response is not long last lasting and real, so it is a transient response. It can’t be a static or dynamic response as the output doesn’t match the input and also there’s no chance of error response. "

Then we apply partial fraction to the equation and we get values of A, B, C as 1, -4/3, 1/3 and then inverse Laplace transform is applied to C(s) and we get response as  1-1/3(4e-t – e-4t)."
