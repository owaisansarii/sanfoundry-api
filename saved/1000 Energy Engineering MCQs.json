The moisture of steam also makes the ash wet and it would gain a light amount of weight which becomes a bit difficult to move ash at a longer distances."

        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: a\nExplanation:  The rate of air supply has marked effect on the speed of ignition in case of under feed burning as the rising air cools the raw fuel prior to ignition. At low rate of air fuel, the heat flow by conduction from the incandescent fuel bed downward is faster than the removal of heat by air. This pushes the ignition plane down below the bed surface and creates a maximum depth of incandescent zone."

Assume that there are stations in the given basin names=d as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. It is very important to divide the total basin area in such a way that each located station in the basin represents that area in the true. "
