Hence, the time taken to cover the same displacement (h) with equal velocities will also be equal. Therefore both the objects reach the bottom at the same time.\n"

        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: a\nExplanation: For pure rolling the speed of centre at any instant should be the radius times its angular speed. While going down the incline speed is continuously increasing, so its linear & angular speed will be increasing. Friction will provide the necessary torque required for increasing angular speed. Thus, friction will act upwards so that its torque about the centre will cause the angular speed to increase in the clockwise direction.\n"

        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: c\nExplanation: The equation of motions will be: Mgsinθ – f = Ma, where f is the friction & a is acceleration. Also, fR = Ia/R. From this equation ‘f’ will be substituted in the first equation: Mgsinθ – Ia/R2 = Ma.\n∴ a = Mgsinθ / (I/R2+ M). Thus, more the value of I lesser will be the acceleration.\nMoment of inertia of ring = MR2\nMoment of inertia of disc= MR2/2\nMoment of inertia of solid sphere = 2MR2/5\nThe solid sphere has the least moment of inertia, so it will have the maximum acceleration & hence it will take the least time.

The tangent to a streamline gives the direction of velocity at that point, so two streamlines cannot intersect as at the point of intersection we will not be able to draw a single tangent. In case of steady flow across a pipe, there could be streamlines next to each other having different velocities and hence there will be friction between the streamlines which we call viscosity. If flow is unsteady, but not turbulent, the velocity of a point in a streamline can change. For eg: If we slowly increase the speed of a tap flow will be laminar and speed of a point (on a streamline) will increase with time.\n"

        "Answer": "Answer: b\nExplanation: Imagine a fluid element with its bottom layer having zero velocity and upper layer, at a height ‘h’, having velocity ‘v’.                                                                                                                                        As the fluid moves, the bottom layer stays as it is, while the other layers will move relative to the bottom layer.                                                                                                                                                                                          So, the strain (=v*Δt/h) continuously increases with time.                                                                                                  So we talk about strain rate (=v*Δt/h*Δt = v/h) and not about strain.                                                                     And we say that stress is proportional to strain rate.                                                                                             Therefore the coefficient of viscosity is the ratio of stress & strain rate.\n"

        "Answer": "Answer: c\nExplanation: In the case of liquids when temperature increases, viscosity decreases because it is the result of molecular bonds (electromagnetic forces) between particles which weaken due to random motion brought about by increase in temperature.                                                                                                 In the case of gases, the molecules vibrate more randomly, leading to more obstruction in the path of bodies trying to move through it. And we interpret this increased obstruction as increased viscosity of the gas.\n"

The maximum displacement, as seen from the graph, is different for both so their amplitudes are different. SHMs have maximum speed at their mean positions. Both the curves have different slopes at their mean positions so their maximum velocities are different.

A person standing below him on the ground hears the first sound to be of frequency 120Hz. What is the height of the building? Speed of sound = 330m/s. Take g=9.81m/s2.",

        "Answer": "Answer: a\nExplanation: Apparent frequency F = f(330+v0)/(330+v8)\n= 10(330)/(330-10) = 10.31Hz.\nWavelength = 330/F\n= 330/10.31\n= 32.007m = 32m.\n"

        "Question": "A man is moving towards a wall with a source of sound in his hand. Frequency of source = 50Hz. Speed of man = 8m/s. If the man sends one pulse of sound, what will be the frequency heard by him after sound reflects off the wall? Speed of sound = 330m/s.",
        "Options": [
            "a) 53.86Hz",
            "b) 52.48Hz",
            "c) 51.24Hz",
            "d) 52.45Hz"
        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: c\nExplanation: Apparent frequency only depends on velocity and not the distance between source and observer.                                                                                                                                                                               So, maximum frequency will be heard when speed is maximum, which is at the start.                                             F = 50(330)/(330-20)\n= 53.22Hz.\n"
