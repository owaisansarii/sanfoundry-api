        "Answer": "Answer: c\nExplanation: Additional base layers can be spread over a large area of the subgrade to strengthen it, but care should be taken to check that the thickness doesn’t increase a lot. There is no use of increasing thickness of a weaker soil unnecessarily. Silt cannot be compacted easily; it requires high water to do so. Dehydrating the soil would make it difficult to compact it."

        "Answer": "Answer: b\nExplanation: When the compaction is carried out, it reduces the gaps between the soil particles and increases the density of soil. Moisture content and dry density vary linearly only up to a certain point. After the optimum moisture content point, an increase in moisture content would decrease the dry density. So, the dry density does not increase continuously."

Since the percent passing 0.074 mm sieve is more than 35% in question (60%), the soil is fine grained. The value of liquid limit must be a minimum of 41% for groups A – 5 and A – 7. Since the value in question is 45%, it may be A – 5 or A – 7. If the maximum plasticity index is 10, then it is A – 5, and if the minimum is 11, it is group A – 7.

T represents the thickness and C represents the C-vale. First, the thickness of each layer is converted in terms of their respective gravel equivalent (g).\nFor bituminous concrete represented as bc, \\(\\frac{T_g}{T_{bc}}=(\\frac{C_{bc}}{C_g})^{1/5}\\) \n\\(T_g=T_bc (\\frac{C_{bc}}{C_g})^{1/5}=10×(\\frac{62}{15})^{1/5}=13.28 cm\\) \nFor cement-treated base represented as ctb,\\(\\frac{T_g}{T_{ctb}} =(\\frac{C_{ctb}}{C_g})^{1/5}\\) \n\\(T_g=T_{ctb}(\\frac{C_{ctb}}{C_g})^{1/5}=20×(\\frac{200}{15})^{1/5}=33.58 cm\\) \nFor gravel sub-base, the thickness Tg=10 cm as in the question.\nThe actual pavement thickness, T = 10+20+10 = 40 cm\nEquivalent to gravel thickness = 13.28+33.58+10 = 56.86 cm\nTherefore, the equivalent C-value can be found as\n\\(\\frac{T_g}{T}=(\\frac{C}{C_g})^{1/5}\\) \n\\(C=(\\frac{T_g}{T})^5×C_g=(\\frac{56.86}{40})^5×15=87.06≈87\\)"

The plate load test was conducted using a 30 cm diameter plate and the pressure at 0.5 cm deflection for the subgrade was found out to be 1.4 kg/cm2 and the pressure over 20 cm thick base course 0.5 cm deflection is obtained as 4 kg/cm2.",

Burmister can be used to find the necessary parameters. A sample of the same chart with values and data pertaining to the question is shown below. All the computations have been represented in one chart.\nFor F2 = 0.316 and z/a = 15/15 = 1, the ratio of elastic modulus of subgrade and pavement can be obtained as 50.

            "d) Cuboidal"
        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: c\nExplanation: Mostly for any construction purpose, the angular aggregates are preferred due to their binding, stability and friction properties. The areas of the pavement where the aggregates extending above cement paste are very small or are not rough and angular lead to the polished aggregates. This reduces the skid resistance of the pavement.\n"

        "Options": [
            "a) \\(R=\\frac{0+A-M}{P}×100\\) ",

            "d) \\(R=\\frac{0+A-M}{P}\\)"
        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: b\nExplanation: The equation for the benefit-cost ratio is given by:\n\\(\\frac{B}{C}=\\frac{R-R_i}{H_i-H}\\) \nIn the equation, R is the total annual road user cost of the existing pavement and Ri is the road user cost of the newly proposed highway. H is the total annual highway cost of the existing pavement and Hi is the total annual highway cost of the newly proposed highway. Using the values from the question,\n\\(\\frac{B}{C}=\\frac{2352300-1258250}{380290-136340}=4.49 \\) \nThe ratio is greater than 1, so the proposal should be taken forward."

        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: a\nExplanation: \\(R=\\frac{0+A-M}{P×100}\\) is the correct formula used to find the percentage of rate of return. Since it is a percentage, the ratio must be multiplied with 100. O refers to the savings in annual road user cost, A is the annual savings in accident cost, M is the additional maintenance cost per annum and P refers to the capital cost of the improvement."
