        "Answer": "Answer: a\nExplanation: The hinged blade allows rigid body rotation about the hinge point which is acted upon by restoring moment due to centrifugal force acting on the rotating blade. For the hinge that lies in the plane of the rotor disk, there’s an out-of-plane deflection of the blades produced. This is known as flap motion. When the deflection of blade along vertical hinge arises, it is known as lag motion.\n"

And all the ratios are equal to 1, i.e \\(\\frac {P_2}{P_1}\\)=1, \\(\\frac {T_2}{T_1}\\)=1, \\(\\frac {\\rho_2}{\\rho_1}\\)=1. This can be found by calculation when we put m=1.

Entropy change is negative if the upstream medium is subsonic and hence no shock waves occur in subsonic medium, else second law is violated.\n"

Apart from this the temperature of the fluid which is immediately at the surface has the same temperature as the surface which is known as the wall temperature. The velocity profile inside a boundary layer increases along the y – direction until it becomes equal to the freestream velocity. The only property that is incorrect is that the thermal boundary layer is equal to the velocity boundary layer.\nThe boundary of thermal layer is defined as the layer where the outer edge temperature becomes equal to the freestream temperature.

For subsonic flow, the siffuder’s performance is lower resulting in efficiency which is less than unity. And for the hypersonic flow the efficiency is greater than unity since it has a better shock recovery.\n"
