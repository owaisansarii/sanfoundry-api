        "Answer": "Answer: b\nExplanation: The partial fraction expansion of the given X(z) is\n\\(X(z)= \\frac{2z}{z-1}-\\frac{z}{z-0.5}\\) \nIn this case ROC is 0.5<|z|<1 is a ring, which implies that the signal is two sided. Thus one of the signal corresponds to a causal signal and the other corresponds to an anti causal signal. Obviously, the ROC given is the overlapping of the regions |z|>0.5 and |z|<1. Hence the pole p2=0.5 provides the causal part and the pole p1=1 provides the anti causal part. SO, if we apply the inverse z-transform we get\nx(n)= -2u(-n-1)-(0.5)nu(n)."

        "Answer": "Answer: a\nExplanation: The sampling of an analog signal is performed by a sample-and-hold (S/H) circuit. The sampled signal is then quantized and converted to digital form. Usually, the S/H is integrated into the (A/D) converter. The S/H is a digitally controlled analog circuit that tracks the analog input signal during the sample mode and then holds it fixed during the hold mode to the instantaneous value of the signal at the time the system is switched from the sample mode to the hold mode."

        "Answer": "Answer: a\nExplanation: The ideal reconstruction filter is an ideal low pass filter and its impulse response extends for all time. Hence the filter is noncausal and physically nonrealizable. Although the interpolation filter with impulse response given can be approximated closely with some delay, the resulting function is still impractical for most applications where D/A conversion are required."

        "Answer": "Answer: a\nExplanation: D/A conversion is usually performed by combining a D/A converter with a sample-and hold (S/H) and followed by a low pass (smoothing) filter. The D/A converter accepts at its input, electrical signals that correspond to a binary word, and produces an output voltage or current that is proportional to the value of the binary word."
