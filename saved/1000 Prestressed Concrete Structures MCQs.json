            "a) Thick cement grout",
            "b) Slurry cement grout",

            "d) Watery cement grout"
        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: b\nExplanation: In moderate damage it is recommended that welded wire fabrics be attached to drilled dowels placed at about 500mm spacing or to the existing reinforcement in the damaged area and if the prestressing strands are exposed, sufficient care must be taken so as not to damage the steel during the cleaning operation and the exposed strands should be coated with epoxy resin bonding compound or slurry cement grout before patching."

        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: d\nExplanation: Elastomers have excellent adhesion to concrete and are not suspectable to softening within the normal range of ambient temperatures and normally Elastomers exhibit a higher degree of elongation of as much as 10 percent extension but in practice, this should be limited to 50 percent and the groove depth to width ratio should be 1.2, the material should be prevented from adhering to the bottom so that the crack remains free as a live crack."
