Each primary oocyte finishes the first round of meiosis to form one secondary oocyte and the first polar body. The secondary oocyte then undergoes a second round of meiosis to create one egg and a second polar body. And no more primary oocytes are added during the lifetime of the female.

        "Answer": "Answer: c\nExplanation: Follicular phase is an important phase to ensure the development of egg and maturation of the follicle it is contained in. It is also characterized by the thickening of uterine wall. These changes are brought about the pituitary hormones LH and FSH and the ovarian hormone estrogen. Progesterone is required for egg release and it peaks during the luteal phase.\n"

However, the female tract prevents most of them from reaching the fallopian tube with only one sperm being able to fertilize the egg. However, in rare cases where female releases two eggs (one from each ovary), there’s a probability of conceiving twins.

In polyploidy conditions, after the telophase stage of cell division, cytokinesis fails to occur which results in an increase in a whole set of chromosomes in an organism. Polyploidy is often seen in plants and it results in sterility in animals.\n"

        "Answer": "Answer: a\nExplanation: The presence of protease (protein digesting enzymes) and RNase (RNA digesting enzymes) in the presence of the virulent or avirulent strains will not affect the process of transformation. But on the contrary, when the DNase is present, the process of transformation will not occur. This proves that the transformation process cannot occur as long as the DNase enzyme is present. The role of nuclease is to cleave the phosphodiester bonds between the nucleotides of nucleic acids.\n"

        "Answer": "Answer: a\nExplanation: Only DNase has the ability to inhibit transformation. The other enzymes like RNase and lipase do not possess that ability. The process of transformation is not seen when the biochemical DNase is with S-strain. Lipase is an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis (H2O addition) of lipids and fats. The process of transformation will occur in lipids. As a result, R-strains will be produced in lipids.\n"
