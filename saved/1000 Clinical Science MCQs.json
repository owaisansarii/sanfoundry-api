        "Answer": "Answer: b\nExplanation: Our body is made of almost 60% of water and maintaining the water balance in the body is important. The lining of the respiratory tract contains mucus to trap any unwanted particles in the air. Even the lungs contain some percentage of water in form of moisture to better facilitate the exchange of gases in the body. Thus, when the air that is sent into the body has a low moisture content, it starts taking in moisture from the body which in the long run can desiccate the cells and cause bleeding. This causes the lung compliance the fall as well. "

        "Answer": "Answer: c\nExplanation:  The fats in their digested state consist of free fatty acids, monoglycerides, cholesterol and lysolipids. They cannot be absorbed directly by the enterocytes of the villi. Thus, the digested fats are encapsulated into small balls of bile which allow them to enter the villi and get absorbed by the enterocytes. These enterocytes have microvilli to allow better absorption. On entering the enterocytes, monoglycerides, cholesterol and lysolipids react with 2 units of Fatty acids to form these enter the lacteals, a part of the lymphatic system.  From here, they can enter blood as needed. "

        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: d\nExplanation: Amylase is a slightly basic enzyme and so it needs a basic medium to work.  When the food is ingested, the mouth has a basic medium due to the presence of saliva. Thus, the salivary amylase starts digesting the food. When the food enters the stomach, the acidic medium stops the work of the salivary amylase. When the food moves to the duodenum, the pancreatic amylase starts working.  "

Thus, blood group A has antigen A and it produces antibody B against the blood group B which contains antigen B. When a blood test is done, the blood of group A will clump up when antigen B is added to the taken blood. In the same way, the blood of group B will clump when antigen A is added. For blood group AB, no clumping happens and for group O, clumping happens for both Antigen A and B. "

        "Answer": "Answer: d\nExplanation: For the first step in the healing process, there is a formation of the blood clot and inflammation takes place. This inflammation is due to the WBCs destroying all the harmful materials. This area receives more of blood flow to remove the dead WBCs and to provide nutrients. After inflammation, the person is given activities to allow weight bearing. This allows for the nutrients to be better absorbed and the bone to become stronger. The granular tissue is the matrix on which the cartilageous tissue will grow and then get ossified. As the bone heals, weight bearing causes it to regain its old shape.    "

Glucocorticoids are important to the immune system. When conditions like Hypoglycemia, hypothermia or low glucocorticoids happen, the body is actively trying to raise their quantity so the brain signals are high.

        "Answer": "Answer: a\nExplanation: In order to allow blood to flow normally, muscles also play an important part. Thus, during surgery, EMG waves are taken to ensure the even spread when a general anesthesia is given. This anesthesia contains neuromuscular drugs so that the pain perception goes down during surgery and so the body does not react when in surgery.

The areas around the electrodes are coated with electrode gel to allow better signal reception. Due to its size, it covers a better surface area. These electrodes are mostly disposable so the risk of infection is low. Since they must be mass produced and then disposed, they are not so costly. "

        "Answer": "Answer: c\nExplanation:  Korotkoff sounds are heard while BP is measured using a cuff. The microphone is placed on the brachial artery, near the inner side of the elbow (antecubital fossa).  The cuff is inflated to a [reset pressure level, around up to 30mmHg/s. The pressure is then released at around 3 – 5 mmHg/s. When the air is leaking out, Korotkoff sounds are heard. When the first Korotkoff sound (systolic) is heard, the system starts recording and when the last Korotkoff sound (diastolic) is heard, the system stops recording. The cuff gets completely deflated with 2 – 3 seconds after the last sound is heard.  "

        "Answer": "Answer: a\nExplanation: Myelin sheath is a sheath of fats covering the length of the axon with small breaks between them called the Nodes of Ranvir. Since the sheath is made of fats and fats are insulators, the impulses cannot travel in them. In a absence of myelin sheath, the impulses would have moved by depolarizing the adjacent point. However, since the fats of myelin sheath are blocking it, the impulses move by jumping between the Nodes of Ranvir. This increases the speed of conduction. "

        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: b\nExplanation: A person suffering from schizophrenia suffers from problems like hallucinations, listening to non existent sounds etc. The persistent problem can be analyzed by looking at the brain scan which shows that the white matter in a particular part of the brain has become more than normal. Since white matter is responsible for sending impulses, a bigger area of white matter will mean faster travelling of impulses and therefore such thoughts. However, since the CT shows the negatives of the original, the white matter will look gray and gray matter will look white. Thus, in a scan, if there is a large gray area and the person suffers from symptoms like hallucinations or anxiety etc, then it’s a high possibility that they have schizophrenia. "

        "Answer": "Answer: c\nExplanation:  When the gradient and RF coils are powered off, the magnetized elements get demagnetized and this causes the image to be formed. T1 is the time for the elements to go back to the original, demagnetized state. T2 is the time needed for the elements to go out of phase. T2* is the time needed for the spin to dephase. T2* is important for fMRI because oxygenated hemoglobin is diamagnetic while deoxygenated hemoglobin is paramagnetic. Thus, the T2* star time will be different for the two of them and the amount of oxygen used by the brain can be mapped. "

        "Answer": "Answer: b\nExplanation: The body functions with the help of oxygen. The oxygen supply allows glycolysis (the breakdown of the sugar molecules), the first step in generating ATP.  Thus, when the brain has a good amount of oxygen supply, the neurons will work properly. The supply of oxygen may affect the activity levels of neurons. Maybe diseased neurons will show a different pattern of oxygen consumption.  Since oxygen is provided by the blood, thus the researchers came to the conclusion that blood supply and neuronal activity are connected and thus it forms the underlying principle of fMRI. "

        "Answer": "Answer: d\nExplanation: In pair production, an incoming photon of 1.02 MeV reacts with the nucleus and disintegrates into a positron and negatron. Positron due to high energy and low mass gets repelled from the nucleus and on meeting an electron, annihilation takes place. In disintegration, a high energy photon is absorbed by the nucleus which makes it excited and radioactive. To become stable again, it emits various radiations. Since both these techniques emit a large variety of radiations, they are used to destroy the cancerous cells and thus used for therapeutic purposes. "

The incoming or the outgoing blood exerts pressure on these valves and open them, allowing the blood to flow. Once the normal flow of blood due to heart contractions has ceased, the valves close. The Autograft valve, Xenograft Valve and Homograft valves are all valves that have been taken from living beings. The autograft valve is taken from the same human being, mostly from the inferior vena cava. Xenograft valve is a bovine(cow) or a porcine(pig) valve. Homograft valves are valves taken from another human.  "

        "Answer": "Answer: b\nExplanation: Insulin pump almost works like an artificial pancreas. They have detectors which keep monitoring the amount of sugar in the blood periodically and if the sugar exceeds normal levels, insulin is injected in them. Glucometer and Gluco Strips are ways of checking the amount of sugar in the body. If these devices are used then the insulin needs to be given manually. Potable pulse oximeter is used to measure the amount of oxygen in the blood which can be indicative of the amount. "
