        "Options": [
            "a) Increase in mass either due to accumulation or due to changes that body undergoes internally",
            "b) Increase in mass due to internally cell division and increase in number due to replication are twin characteristic of growth",
            "c) All living organisms grow throughout their life",
            "d) Growth is a sufficient characteristic to determine whether an organism is living or non-living"
        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: b\nExplanation: Increase in mass due to internal division and increase in number of organisms are twin characteristics of growth. In non-living organisms increase in mass occurs due to accumulation whereas in living organisms it happens due to the proteins and carbohydrates that we intake. Living organisms except plants grow until certain period of their life and then stop growing. Growth is not a sufficient a characteristic to determine if an organism is living. Sometimes it’s possible that even mountains and sand dunes grow due to an accumulation of sand.\n"

        "Answer": "Answer: b\nExplanation: Slime moulds can reproduce either sexually or asexually. During favourable conditions they form an aggregation called plasmodium which may grow and spread over several feet.  Under unfavourable conditions, plasmodium differentiates to form fruiting bodies bearing spores at their tips which then get dispersed through air currents. Slime moulds reproduce either sexually or asexually.\n"

        "Answer": "Answer: a\nExplanation: Steward in 1964 proposed a modified scheme of inter-conversion of starch and sugar for stomatal movement. Theory of photosynthesis in guard cells was given by Von Mohl in 1856 and proposed that chloroplasts in the guard cells photosynthesize leading to production of sugar. Theory of glycolate metabolism was given by Zelitch in 1963 and he proposed that production of glycolic acid in the guard cells is a necessary factor in stomatal opening. Active Potassium Pump theory was given by Fujino. Levitt & Rashke in 1975 supported the theory of the K+ ion transport active mechanism requires ATP.\n"
