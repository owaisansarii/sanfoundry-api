The piston moves downward increasing the volume of the combustion chamber and allowing an air fuel mixture. This step is known as suction. The charge taken in the cylinder is compressed during the compression stroke. During power stroke, the high pressure developed due to combustion of fuel causes the piston to be forced forward or backward at regular intervals.
