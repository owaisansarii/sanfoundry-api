The infinite pattern in parallel as a whole is considered as to be Rx.\nThus, Rx = R + (R||Rx)\nSolving for Rx, we get Rx = 1.62R, where R=10ohm.\nSo we have Rx = (1.62ohm)*(10ohm), which gives Rx=16.2ohm\nTherefore, Req = 5 + (10||16.2)\n=> 5 + [(10*16.2)/(10+16.2)]\n=> Req = 5 + (162/26.2) which gives Req=11.18 ohm.\n"

        "Answer": "Answer: a\nExplanation: At a given value of vBE, increasing vCE increases the reverse-bias voltage on the collector–base junction, and thus increases the width of the depletion region of this junction. This in turn results in a decrease in the effective base width W. Also the saturation current is inversely proportional to the width, the saturation current will increase and also makes collector current increases proportionally. This is the Early Effect. For the reasons mentioned above, it is also known as the base-width modulation effect. "

The ability or a potential of an amplifier in order to reproduce the distortion-less nature of input signal is known as ‘Fidelity’.\nFidelity of an amplifier is dependent on the frequency response and the bandwidth of an amplifier to the greater extent.

            "d) None of the mentioned"
        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: a\nExplanation: Thermal runaway is a growing process which can ultimately harm the transistor due to unnecessary internal heating or increase in ambient temperature. It occurs due to increase in collector current ahead of the maximum specified value. Additionally, it also occurs due to excessive internal power dissipation above the maximum allowed value. Thermal runaway can be disallowed by maintaining the provision of thermal stability in addition to the treatment of heat sink.\nAccording to thermal stability condition, VCE should be less than Vcc/2 results in the Q-point operation at a safe level. On the contrary, if the location of Q-point is at VCE > Vcc/2, then the transistor is more likely to get damaged due to thermal runaway."

Since the stability factor of circuit gets unnatural due to several variations, bias stabilization has a provision of maintaining the Q-point condition irrespective of the changes in temperature or transistor parameters and in that way ensuring the confined level of bias stability to circuits."

        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: c\nExplanation:  When the transistor starts operating, temperature at the junction increases. Hence IC increases. As a result of which, Ie increases. Due to this increase in Ie, voltage drop across Re increases. This reduces the forward voltage across the emitter. Thus Ib reduces. \n\n\n\tWe know that, for any value of ICO,  IC = β * Ib +(1+ β) ICO\nwhere  ICO =reverse saturation current   (increases with temperature)\n            β = gain\n\n\n\t\n\n        Therefore, β  and ICO increases and at the same time there is decrease in Ib. Hence above equation confirms that IC can be maintained within limits. Thus the circuit is more thermally stable and the operating point is more stable."

        "Answer": "Answer: b\nExplanation:  Non- linear distortion generally happens because of essence of non linearity in the exchange qualities of transistor.\nIf a large amplitude signal is connected to an amplifier to extend the operation of a device beyond the linear operational range, then it also generates the non – linear distortion.\nThe effective input to an amplifier starts to reduce as the negative feedback is introduced; which eventually helps it to operate in the linear region.\nThis ability of negative feedback turns out to be beneficial in minimizing the level of non-linear distortion.

A fin of a heat sink may be measured to be a flat plate with heat flow in one end and being dissipated into the surrounding fluid as it travels to the other.  As heat flows through the fin, the grouping of the thermal resistance of the heat sink impeding the flow and the heat lost due to convection, the temperature of the fin and, consequently, the heat transfer to the fluid, will decrease from the bottom to the end of the fin. Fin efficiency is defined as the actual heat transferred by the fin, separated by the heat transfer were the fin to be isothermal. "

        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: a\nExplanation:  Spreading resistance occurs when thermal energy is transferred from a minute area to a larger area in a substance with finite thermal conductivity. In a heat sink, this means that heat does not distribute uniformly through the heat sink base. The spreading resistance occurrence is shown by how the heat travels from the heat source location and causes a large temperature gradient between the heat source and the edges of the heat sink. This means that some fins are at a lower temperature than if the heat source were uniform from corner to corner of the base of the heat sink. "

        "Answer": "Answer:  c\nExplanation: Since the resistor-capacitor combination in the RC Oscillator circuit also acts as an attenuator producing an attenuation of -1/29th ( Vo/Vi = β ) per stage, the gain of the amplifier must be sufficient to overcome the circuit losses.\nTherefore, in our three stage RC network above the amplifier gain must be greater than 29."

        "Answer": "Answer: a\nExplanation:  The physical size of the quartz crystal affects the final or fundamental frequency of oscillations. The fundamental frequency is generally called the crystals “characteristic frequency”. The crystals characteristic or characteristic frequency is inversely proportional to its physical thickness between the two metalized surfaces."

        ],
        "Answer": "Answer:  c\nExplanation:  In oscillators using positive feedback it is important that amplitude of the oscillator output remains stable. Therefore the closed loop gain must be 1 (unity). In other words, the gain within the loop; provided by the amplifier, should exactly match the losses (caused by the feedback circuit) within the loop."

There are two Bode plots one for gain (or magnitude) and one for phase.\n The Nyquist plot combines gain and phase into one plot in the complex plane. It is drawn by plotting the complex gain g(iω) for all frequencies ω. That is, the plot is a curve in the plane parameterized by ω."
