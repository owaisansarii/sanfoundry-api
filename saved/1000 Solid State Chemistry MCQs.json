        "Question": "Lighter atoms _________",
        "Options": [
            "a)\tFluoresce  strongly",
            "b)\tFluoresce less strongly",
            "c)\tDoesn’t Fluoresce",
            "d)\tFluoresce very very strongly"
        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: b\nExplanation: Lighter atoms also fluoresce, but less strongly, since fluorescence is strongest when the incident radiation has a wavelength that is only slightly shorter than the absorption edge (=IP) of the atoms."

        "Question": "When the X-rays strike a sample then the X-rays of the same wavelength as the incident beam is re-emitted and this is known as____________",
        "Options": [
            "a)\tModified radiation",
            "b)\tSame radiation",
            "c)\tCoherent radiation",
            "d)\tNon coherent radiation"
        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: c\nExplanation: When X-rays strike a sample two types of scattered rays are produced. In the first, the incident beam sets the electrons of the atoms into vibration, the X-rays of the same wavelength as the incident beam is re-emitted and are the characteristic diffracted radiation with which we are familiar. This is known as coherent, unmodified radiation."

        "Question": "Organic and organic based materials give which type of powder patterns?",
        "Options": [
            "a)\tVery good quality powder pattern",
            "b)\tVery poor quality powder pattern",
            "c)\tDoesn’t give powder pattern at all",
            "d)\tHigh concentrated powder pattern"
        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: b\nExplanation: Due to the combined effects of reduced diffracted intensity and increased background intensity, organic and organic-based (e.g. polymeric) materials give poor quality powdered patterns."
