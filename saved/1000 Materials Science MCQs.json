        "Answer": "Answer: d\nExplanation: Polymeric molecules are aggregates of a large number of monomer units and possess high molecular mass. Hooke’s law generally does not apply to polymers as the stress developed is not directly proportional to deformation. Due to low densities, strength to mass ratio of polymers is often comparable to metals and ceramics."
