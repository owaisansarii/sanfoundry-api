        "Answer": "Answer: b\nExplanation: Each parallel path in lap winding is under the influence of one pair of poles, so if a machine consists of multiple pairs of poles then dissimilarities occurs, due to which unequal voltages may be induced in the paths and a circulating current may flow. In wave winding each path is under the influence of all poles, so voltages are induced in each path causing no such dissimilarities like lap winding. Equalizers in lap windings are used to remove this dissimilarity, they’re not needed in wave winding."

This is the most important characteristic as it reveals the nature of the magnetization of the machine. It is easy to determine as the generator is on no load and so only low rated prime mover will serve the purpose. It is commonly called the open–circuit/magnetization characteristic."

        "Answer": "Answer: b\nExplanation: Speed regulation is defined as a ratio of difference of no-load speed with full load speed with no-load speed. Here, no-load speed is more than the full load speed. Thus, we divide difference by no-load value and not by full load value."

        "Answer": "Answer: b\nExplanation: Speeds greater than rated speeds can be obtained by lowering the flux of shunt field motor. Field cannot be made any stronger, it can only be weakened by this method. Thus, speed lower than the rated speed can’t be obtained. "

The full load in small machines cannot obtained by cutting out all the external resistances present in the generator field. Sufficient reduction in the motor field current is necessary to achieve full-load conditions resulting in speeds greater than the rated value."
