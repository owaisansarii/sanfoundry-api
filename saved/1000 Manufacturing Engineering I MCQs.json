        "Answer": "Answer: c\nExplanation: In general, metals exist in a crystalline form. Iron and Tungsten being metals takes up body centered cubic crystalline structure at room temperature. The ceramic compound–silica (SiO2), can exist either in a crystalline form or in a non-crystalline form (amorphous form). While quartz, tridymite and cristobalite are known as its crystalline forms which are being differentiated based on SiO4 tetrahedra linkage style, silica’s non-crystalline (amorphous) form is just called as the silica glass."

These both thermoplastics are semi-crystalline nature, out of which LDPE exhibits a crystallinity of about 50-60% and HDPE of about 90%. Some people may term HDPE as crystalline, but it is more appropriate to restrict it in the category of semi-crystalline class."

As one can relate that, more the number of grain boundaries (fine is the grain size), more is the obstruction to the movement of dislocation, thus more is the strength of a metal. So, if grain size increases, its strength decreases. This phenomenon can be best understood with the help of Hall-Petch relation."

        "Answer": "Answer: c\nExplanation: Binary phase diagrams has two components. Apart from temperature and pressure, we will be having one composition variable for each of the phases in equilibrium. In order to simplify the Gibbs phase rule on paper (in 2D), binary phase diagrams are usually drawn at atmospheric pressure, showing variations in temperature and composition only. Pressure changes often produce no significant effect on the equilibrium and, therefore, it is customary to ignore the pressure variable and the vapour phase. The modified condensed rule is represented as:\nF = C – P + 1\n"

        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: a\nExplanation: In percussion welding, two pieces are welded by a high intensity short duration arc followed by very rapid or percussive impacting of the workpieces. There are three different methods of arc initiation in percussion welding viz., low voltage with drawn arc, high voltage breakdown, and ionising by a fusing tip. With each method, the energy source is a bank of capacitors which is charged by a variable voltage transformer cum rectifier unit."

        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: d\nExplanation: A brazed joint is made in a completely different manner from welded joint. The big difference is in temperature-brazing does not melt the base metals. This means that brazing temperatures are invariably lower than the melting points of the base metals. It joins base metals by creating a metallurgical bond between the filler metal and the surfaces of the two metals being joined. The principle by which the filler metal is drawn through the joint to create this bond is capillary action."

        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: d\nExplanation: The excellent adhesive properties of epoxy resins are due to the attractive forces between the epoxy resin and the surface of the substrate. Typical epoxy resins have pendant hydroxyl (-OH) groups along their chain which can form bonds or strong polar attractions to oxide or hydroxyl surfaces. Most inorganic surface, i.e., metals, minerals, glasses, ceramics, etc. have polarity so they have high surface energy. Organic polymer surfaces are generally less polar (more covalent) thus lower surface energy. "

        "Answer": "Answer: a\nExplanation: When shaping a solid piece of metal by closed die forging, the die is initially open. The work piece is placed in the lower die half, and the top die is then brought down to engage with the work piece The application of pressure between the slowly closing die halves causes the solid to flow plastically within the constrains of the die, being displaced to fill the outer sections of the die cavity."

        "Answer": "Answer: a\nExplanation: Peclet number is the product of Prandtl number and Reynolds number, in other sense, it is the ratio of the heat transfer by convection to the heat transferred by conduction. So, you can consider a pipe with some wall thickness. The wall conducts heat to the fluid. While the heat can also be carried away by the fluid in motion which is called as advection. If the advection term is dominant, then the Peclet number is going to large and thus the hat transfer from the wall is of less importance. Conversely, the heat transfer form the wall to the fluid can be of higher importance in the case of a smaller Peclet number.\n"

        "Answer": "Answer: b\nExplanation: Turbulent flow is chaotic. However, not all chaotic flows are turbulent. Turbulent flow is characterized by the irregular movement of particles of the fluid. In contrast to laminar the fluid does not flow in parallel layers, the lateral mixing is very high, and there is a disruption between the layers. Turbulence is also characterized by recirculation, eddies, and apparent randomness, in other sense, in turbulent flow-the speed of the fluid at a point is continuously undergoing changes in both magnitude and direction."

        "Answer": "Answer: d\nExplanation: Chemical cleaning usually involves the removal of oil and grease from surfaces. The operation consists of one or more of the following processes:\na) Solution: The soil dissolves in the cleaning solution.\nb) Saponification: A chemical reaction converts animal or vegetable oils into a soap that is soluble in water.\nc) Emulsification: The cleaning solution reacts with the soil or lubricant deposits and forms an emulsion; the soil and the emulsifier then become suspended in the emulsion.\nd) Dispersion: The concentration of soil on the surface is decreased by surface active elements in the cleaning solution.\ne) Aggregation: Lubricants are removed from the surface by various agents in the cleanser and are collected as large dirt particles."

        "Answer": "Answer: d\nExplanation: Common cleaning fluids used in conjunction with electrochemical processes for more effective cleaning include the following:\na) Alkaline solutions: A complex combination of water-soluble chemicals, alkaline solutions are the least expensive and most widely used cleaning fluids in manufacturing operations. Small parts may be cleaned in rotating drums or barrels. Most parts are cleaned on continuous conveyors by spraying them with the solution and rinsing them with water.\nb) Emulsions: Emulsions generally consist of kerosene and oil-in-water and various types of emulsifiers.\nc) Solvents: Typically petroleum solvents, chlorinated hydrocarbons, and mineral spirits, solvents generally are used for short runs. Fire and toxicity are major hazards.\nd) Hot vapors: Chlorinated solvents can be used to remove oil, grease, and wax. The solvent is boiled in a container and then condensed. This hot-vapor process is simple, and the cleaned parts are dry.\ne) Acids, salts, and mixtures of organic compounds: These are effective in cleaning parts covered with heavy paste or oily deposits and rust."
