But it is difficult for carbon to neither lose 4 electrons due to its strong force of attraction with the nucleus nor gain 4 electrons since the protons in the nucleus are not sufficient to hold 8 electrons in them. Therefore, carbon forms 4 covalent bonds with other atoms, thereby, exhibiting tetravalency.\n"

            "d) soluble, biodegradable"
        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: a\nExplanation: Organic toxins are poisonous substances derived from living organisms. Most of the organic toxins are water insoluble and non-biodegradable. These high persistent toxins are, therefore, transferred from lower trophic level to higher trophic level through food chain. Organic toxins are almost equally harmful as the synthetic chemicals to humans.\n"

        "Answer": "Answer: a\nExplanation: As we go up the food chain, the concentration of pollutant increases. This process is called biomagnification. This process refers to the buildup of toxins in the food chain. At each trophic level, the pollutant gets 10 times more concentrated. Therefore, the animals near the top of the food chain gets the most affected by the toxins.\n"
