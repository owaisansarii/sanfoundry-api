        "Answer": "Answer: c\nExplanation: Resting membrane potential or the resting potential is the relative static membrane potential of quiescent cell. That is if the resting membrane potential of a neuron is about -70 mV (mV=millivolt) it means that the inside of the neuron is 70 mV less than the outside of the neuron. An action potential occurs when the potential of the membrane of a given axonal position increases and decreases rapidly. This depolarization causes depolarization of adjacent positions in a similar way."

        "Answer": "Answer: c\nExplanation: The tympanic membrane separates the ear canal from the middle ear cavity. The pinna scatters acoustic waves so that some of the scattered energy enters the auditory canal and pushes against the tympanic membrane during a wave of compression. The distance membrane moves is a function of the force and velocity with which the air molecules strike it and is, therefore, related to the loudness of sound. "

Bone conduction, on the other hand, refers to the transmission of sound to the internal ear mediated by mechanical vibration of the cranial bones and soft tissues.  Clinical observation has shown that hard-of-hearing patients with middle ear disease usually have normal hearing by bone conduction, whereas patients with inner ear involvement have decreased or diminished bone-conduction."

When a molecule absorbs radiant energy, it can increase its internal energy in a variety of ways. The various molecular energy states are quantized and the amount of energy necessary to cause any change in any one of the above energy states would generally correspond to specific regions of the electromagnetic spectrum.
