        "Answer": "Answer: c\nExplanation: The primary nozzles of the jet mixers are prone to clogging. If the particles have a diameter greater than that of the nozzles, the nozzles get blocked. In order to avoid this, the largest particle fed, should have a diameter smaller than that of the nozzles’.
