        "Answer": "Answer: b\nExplanation: Nickel, which is added as a solution of its salts, gets reduced during sintering and forms a coating of a few monolayer on the surface of the W particles. By diffusing over the W particles, Ni accumulates at the necks of the particles from where the nickel penetrates the grain boundaries. This presence of nickel at the grain boundaries greatly increases the grain boundaryself-diffusion of tungsten. Thus, the segregation of the additive at the interparticle boundary creates a short circuit diffusion path for the rapid diffusion of the base metal resulting in enhanced densification.\n"

The other reasons for not achieving theoretical density in practice are presence of agglomeration, poor packing, and non-uniform particle size.\n"

        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: a\nExplanation: Densification is proportional to the shrinkage or the number of pores removed in the case of single component systems (e.g. metals). In the case of multicomponent systems such as premixed powders, during sintering solid solutions may form resulting in an expansion rather than shrinkage. Expansion of the compact may also take place due to the entrapped gases. Thus, densification cannot be treated as equal to the amount of porosity removed.\n"

This is called activated sintering and is found to occur in refractory metals like W, Mo, Ta, Hf, and rhenium with Ni or Pd as the activators. The improvement in sintering characteristics in the presence of dopants is due to the enhanced grain boundary diffusion caused by the presence of dopants at the grain boundary of these refractory metals.\n"

In operation, lubricating oil stored in these pores feed the bearing surface through these interconnected pores, when the temperature increases during operation. Any oil, which is forced from the loaded zone of the bearing, is later reabsorbed by the pores through capillary action. Since these bearings can operate for long periods of time without additional supply of lubricant, they are convenient to be used where re-lubrication is difficult.\n"
