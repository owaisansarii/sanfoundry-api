Aperiodic Signal does not repeat itself at regular interval of time. Random signals are the signals which have uncertain values at any time. While Deterministic signals are the signals which are constant over a period of time. "

        "Answer": "Answer: a\nExplanation: Delta modulation is an analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog signal conversion technique used for transmission of voice information where quality is not of primary importance. It is the simplest form of differential pulse-code modulation (DPCM) where the difference between successive samples are encoded into n-bit data streams. The two major drawbacks in delta modulation are slope overload and granular noise. When step size becomes too small to track the original waveform it generates an error known as slope overload and granularity occurs when step size is too large."

        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: a\nExplanation: SSB-SC signals are the signals where only one of the side band is transmitted in an AM wave. SSB-SC signal is generated by two methods, frequency discriminator method or filter method and phase discriminator method or phase shift method.  "
