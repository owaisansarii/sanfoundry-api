        "Answer": "Answer: d\nExplanation: In both orthographic and oblique projection, parallel lines in space appear parallel on the projected image. Because of its simplicity, oblique projection is used exclusively for pictorial purposes rather than for formal, working drawings. In an oblique pictorial drawing, the displayed angles among the axes as well as the foreshortening factors (scale) are arbitrary. The distortion created thereby is usually attenuated by aligning one plane of the imaged object to be parallel with the plane of projection thereby creating a true shape, full-size image of the chosen plane."

        "Answer": "Answer: a\nExplanation: Oblique drawing is also the crudest “3D” drawing method but the easiest to master. One way to draw using an oblique view is to draw the side of the object you are looking at in two dimensions, i.e. flat, and then draw the other sides at an angle of 45°, but instead of drawing the sides full size they are only drawn with half the depth creating ‘forced depth’ – adding an element of realism to the object. Even with this ‘forced depth’, oblique drawings look very unconvincing to the eye. For this reason oblique is rarely used by professional designers and engineers."

        "Answer": "Answer: c\nExplanation: Perspective (from Latin: perspicere “to see through”) in the graphic arts is an approximate representation, generally on a flat surface (such as paper), of an image as it is seen by the eye. The two most characteristic features of perspective are that objects are smaller as their distance from the observer increases; and that they are subject to foreshortening, meaning that an object’s dimensions along the line of sight are shorter than its dimensions across the line of sight."

Points can then be located with reference to the origin by giving their numerical coordinates—that is, the positions of their projections along each axis, either in the positive or negative direction. The coordinates of the origin are always all zero, for example (0,0) in two dimensions and (0,0,0) in three."

When the set of parallel lines is perpendicular to a picture plane, the construction is known as one-point perspective, and their vanishing point corresponds to the oculus, or “eye point”, from which the image should be viewed for correct perspective geometry. Traditional linear drawings use objects with one to three sets of parallels, defining one to three vanishing points."

Nomograms use a parallel coordinate system invented by d’Ocagne rather than standard Cartesian coordinates.\nA nomogram consists of a set of n scales, one for each variable in an equation. Knowing the values of n-1 variables, the value of the unknown variable can be found, or by fixing the values of some variables, the relationship between the unfixed ones can be studied. The result is obtained by laying a straightedge across the known values on the scales and reading the unknown value from where it crosses the scale for that variable.

The plinth usually rests directly on the ground or stylobate. According to Semper, the plinth exists to negotiate between a structure and the ground. Semper’s theory has been influential in the development of architecture. "

A simple cornice may be formed just with a crown.\nThe function of the projecting cornice of a building is to throw rainwater free of the building’s walls. In residential building practice, this function is handled by projecting gable ends, roof eaves, and gutters. However, house eaves may also be called “cornices” if they are finished with decorative molding. In this sense, while most cornices are also eaves (in that they overhang the sides of the building), not all eaves are usually considered cornices – eaves are primarily functional and not necessarily decorative, and a cornice has a decorative aspect to it.\n<img src=\"https://www.sanfoundry.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/civil-engineering-drawing-questions-answers-freshers-q6.png\" alt=\"Cornice diagram\" width=\"126\" height=\"175\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-210914\" />\n  Here the part C represents cornice.

The polished and coloured surface is a tradition since ancient Roman times, pozzolona dust is used, that is a sand of volcanic origin and it is responsible for making the surface polished and smooth, but you can also use marble dust or coloured pigments of quartz mixed with lime. History tells that this technique was improved during the Seventeenth and Eighteenth centuries in Venice, that is the reason why it is called “Venetian”, also called Roman plaster.\nThe more layers of Venetian plaster are applied, the more polished and extremely refined is the wall. Obviously it also more expensive because of the labor it needs. "

It is used to bear the load from the railroad ties, to facilitate drainage of water, and also to keep down vegetation that might interfere with the track structure. This also serves to hold the track in place as the trains roll by. It is typically made of crushed stone, although ballast has sometimes consisted of other, less suitable materials, for example burnt clay. The term “ballast” comes from a nautical term for the stones used to stabilize a ship."

        "Answer": "Answer: b\nExplanation: Drilling and Blasting is the controlled use of explosives and other methods such as gas pressure blasting pyrotechnics, to break rock for excavation. It is practiced most often in mining, quarrying and civil engineering such as dam or road construction. The result of rock blasting is often known as a rock cut.\nDrilling and Blasting currently utilizes many different varieties of explosives with different compositions and performance properties. Higher velocity explosives are used for relatively hard rock in order to shatter and break the rock, while low velocity explosives are used in soft rocks to generate more gas pressure and a greater heaving effect. For instance, an early 20th-century blasting manual compared the effects of black powder to that of a wedge, and dynamite to that of a hammer. The most commonly used explosives in mining today are ANFO based blends due to lower cost than dynamite."

        "Answer": "Answer: c\nExplanation: In a large industrial brickworks, clay is taken from the quarry, and then carried by conveyor belt or truck/lorry to the main factory, although it may be stockpiled outside before entering the machinery. When the clay enters the preparation plant (Clay Prep) it is crushed, and mixed with water and other additives which may include breeze, a very fine anthracite that aids firing. This process, which is also known as pugmilling, improves the consistency, firing qualities, texture, and colour of the brick. From here, the processed clay can be extruded into a continuous strip and cut with wires, or put into moulds or presses (also referred to as forming) to form the clay into its final shape. After the forming or cutting, the bricks must be dried, either in the open air, in drying sheds, or in special drying kilns. When the bricks have been dried, they must then be fired or ‘burnt’ in a kiln, to give them their final hardness and appearance."

The top of plinth level is provided with damp proof course which is an additional protection against dampness. Plinth height also prevents storm water/overflowing drainage from directly entering the building in case of heavy rainfall. Generally plinth level is provided at about 300–450 mm above finished ground level. It is suggested that plinth level should be decided by considering the top of the road level, the former should be kept atleast 150 mm higher."

        "Answer": "Answer: a\nExplanation: A beam is a structural element that primarily resists loads applied laterally to the beam’s axis. Its mode of deflection is primarily by bending. The loads applied to the beam result in reaction forces at the beam’s support points. The total effect of all the forces acting on the beam is to produce shear forces and bending moments within the beam, that in turn induce internal stresses, strains and deflections of the beam. Beams are characterized by their manner of support, profile (shape of cross-section), length, and their material."

Being unable to complete a project risks public ridicule. See cost contingency for more information. The estimate or budget contingency is not intended to compensate for poor estimate quality, and is not intended to fund design growth, owner changes, or anything else unrelated to delivering the scope as defined in the estimate documentation. Generally more contingency is needed for earlier estimates due to the higher uncertainty of estimate accuracy."

        "Answer": "Answer: a\nExplanation: In domestic applications, traps are typically U, S, Q or J-shaped pipe located below or within a plumbing fixture. An S-shaped trap is also known as an S-bend. It was invented by Alexander Cummings in 1775 but became known as the U-bend following the introduction of the U-shaped trap by Thomas Crapper in 1880. The new U-bend could not jam, so, unlike the S-bend, it did not need an overflow. The most common of these traps in houses is referred to as a P-trap. It is the addition of a 90 degree fitting on the outlet side of a U-bend, thereby creating a P-like shape."

            "d) Wooden ballast"
        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: a\nExplanation: It is packed between, below, and around the ties. It is used to bear the load from the railroad ties, to facilitate drainage of water, and also to keep down vegetation that might interfere with the track structure. This also serves to hold the track in place as the trains roll by. It is typically made of crushed stone, although ballast has sometimes consisted of other, less suitable materials, for example burnt clay. The term “ballast” comes from a nautical term for the stones used to stabilize a ship."

Today, 54.8% of the world’s railways use a gauge of 1,435 mm (4 ft 8 \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) in), known as standard or international gauge. Gauges wider than standard gauge are called broad gauge; narrower, narrow gauge. Some stretches of track are dual gauge, with three (or sometimes four) parallel rails in place of the usual two, to allow trains of two different gauges to use the same track."

        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: b\nExplanation: With flexible pavement, the highest stress occurs at the surface and the stress decreases as the depth of the pavement increases. Therefore, the highest quality material needs to be used for the surface, while lower quality materials can be used as the depth of the pavement increases. The term “flexible” is used because of the asphalts ability to bend and deform slightly, then return to its original position as each traffic load is applied and removed. It is possible for these small deformations to become permanent, which can lead to rutting in the wheel path over an extended time."

        "Answer": "Answer: b\nExplanation: A single carriageway or undivided highway is a road with one, two or more lanes arranged within a single carriageway with no central reservation to separate opposing flows of traffic.\nA two-lane road or two-lane highway is a single carriageway with one lane for each direction. A single-track road has a single lane with passing places for traffic in both directions. Road traffic safety is generally worse for high-speed single carriageways than for dual carriageways due to the lack of separation between traffic moving in opposing directions."

        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: d\nExplanation: The major factors which governs the thickness of the pavement are ‘Traffic’ and ‘subgrade soil strength’ apart from climatic conditions ( frost action etc.), material characteristics etc.\nHowever, there were no options related to the above discussed.\nOption (Drainage of soil) affects the thickness because the subgrade soil strength (measured in CBR (%)) changes with the density of the soil.\nOption (Stabilisation of soil) also affects the thickness because the stabilized soils do possess higher soil strength/desired properties than the unstabilized.\nOption (Compaction of soil) deals with the drainage of the soils. Drainage affects the performance of the pavement. If the pavement results in a poor performance under drainage condition, an additional “drainage layer” should be provided (IRC 37:2012) and also while strengthening the roads, it is expected to get more characteristic deflection results in providing more thickness than the properly drained pavement."

        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: d\nExplanation: Thomas Telford, born in Dumfriesshire Scotland, was a surveyor and engineer who applied Tresaguet’s road building theories. In 1801 Telford worked for the British Commission of Highlands Roads and Bridges. He became director of the Holyhead Road Commission between 1815 and 1830. Telford extended Tresaguet’s theories, but emphasized high-quality stone. He recognized that some of the road problems of the French could be avoided by using cubical stone blocks.\n         John Loudon McAdam was born in Ayr, Scotland in 1756. In 1787 he became a trustee of the Ayrshire Turnpike in the Scottish Lowlands and during the next seven years this hobby became an obsession. He moved to Bristol, England in 1802 and became a Commissioner for Paving in 1806. On 15 January 1816 he was elected Surveyor-General of roads for the Turnpike Trust, and was now responsible for 149 miles of road. McAdam first put his ideas about road construction into major practice, the first ‘macadamised’ stretch of road being Marsh Road at Ashton Gate, Bristol."

        "Answer": "Answer: a\nExplanation: Stone dust is like a darker, coarser version of sand. It is a byproduct of running stones through a crushing machine to make crushed stone. Its exact composition will obviously depend on what kind of stone was run through the machine. For instance, sometimes granite is run through such a machine; in other cases, it could be limestone, for example. The machine has a screen that traps the larger material (that is, the crushed stone). The smaller material or “screenings” falls through the screen. Depending on the size of the holes in the screen used, it can be so fine in texture that it is basically a powder."

        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: c\nExplanation: Free water: The bulk of water contained in the cell lumina is only held by capillary forces. It is not bound chemically and is called free water. Free water is not in the same thermodynamic state as liquid water: energy is required to overcome the capillary water. Furthermore, free water may contain chemicals, altering the drying characteristics of wood.\nBound or hygroscopic water: Bound water is bound to the wood via hydrogen bond. The attraction of wood for water arises from the presence of free hydroxyl (OH) groups in the cellulose hemicelluloses and lignin molecules in the cell wall. The hydroxyl groups are negatively charged. Because water is a polar liquid, the free hydroxyl groups in cellulose attract and hold water by hydrogen bonding.\nVapor: Water in cell lumina in the form of water vapour is normally negligible at normal temperature and humidity."

It does not create a general softening of the product but only locally relieves strains and stresses locked up within the material. Annealing goes through three phases: recovery, recrystallization, and grain growth. The temperature required to anneal a particular steel depends on the type of annealing to be achieved and the alloying constituents."

        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: d\nExplanation: The primary work surface of the anvil is known as the face. It is generally made of hardened steel and should be flat and smooth with rounded edges for most work. Any marks on the face will be transferred to the work. Also, sharp edges tend to cut into the metal being worked and may cause cracks to form in the workpiece. The face is hardened and tempered to resist the blows of the smith’s hammer, so the anvil face does not deform under repeated use. A hard anvil face also reduces the amount of force lost in each hammer blow. Hammers, tools, and work pieces of hardened steel should never directly strike the anvil face with full force, as they may damage it; this can result in chipping or deforming of the anvil face."

Batching is usually done in two ways: volume batching and weight batching. In case of volume batching the measurement is done in the form of volume whereas in the case of weight batching it is done by the weight.\n     Mixing: In order to create good concrete the mixing of the materials should be first done in dry condition and after it wet condition. The two general methods of mixing are: hand mixing and machine mixing.\n     Transportation and placing of concrete: Once the concrete mixture is created it must be transported to its final location. The concrete is placed on form works and should always be dropped on its final location as closely as possible.\n     Compaction of concrete: When concrete is placed it can have air bubbles entrapped in it which can lead to the reduction of the strength by 30%. In order to reduce the air bubbles the process of compaction is performed. Compaction is generally performed in two ways: by hand or by the use of vibrators."

Even when neither columns nor pilasters are expressed, on an astylar wall it lies upon the architrave (‘main beam’) and is capped by the moldings of the cornice. A frieze can be found on many Greek and Roman buildings, the Parthenon Frieze being the most famous, and perhaps the most elaborate. This style is typical for the Persians."

        "Answer": "Answer: a\nExplanation: An axial flow pump, or AFP, is a common type of pump that essentially consists of a propeller in a pipe. The propeller can be driven directly by a sealed motor in the pipe or mounted to the pipe from the outside or by a right-angle drive shaft that pierces the pipe.\n Fluid particles, in course of their flow through the pump, do not change their radial locations since the change in radius at the entry (called ‘suction’) and the exit (called ‘discharge’) of the pump is very small. Hence the name “axial” pump."

Raw water may be transferred using uncovered ground-level aqueducts, covered tunnels or underground water pipes to water purification facilities.\nWater purification facilities. Treated water is transferred using water pipes (usually underground).\nWater storage facilities such as reservoirs, water tanks, or water towers. Smaller water systems may store the water in cisterns or pressure vessels. Tall buildings may also need to store water locally in pressure vessels in order for the water to reach the upper floors.\nAdditional water pressurizing components such as pumping stations may need to be situated at the outlet of underground or above ground reservoirs or cisterns (if gravity flow is impractical).\nA pipe network for distribution of water to the consumers (which may be private houses or industrial, commercial or institution establishments) and other usage points (such as fire hydrants).\nConnections to the sewers (underground pipes, or aboveground ditches in some developing countries) are generally found downstream of the water consumers, but the sewer system is considered to be a separate system, rather than part of the water supply system.\n\n"

However, owing to insufficient experimental and analytical studies, empirical design formulas for the beam width limitation, with remarkably different results, have been implemented in different design codes. In this paper, parametric studies of the influence of key parameters on the behaviour of wide beam–column connections are conducted based on available test results. An effective beam-width model is analytically developed using the equivalent-frame representation, where the effects of torsion of transverse beams and flexure around the joint core are considered. The validity of the model is verified using flexural strengths of test specimens, covering a wide range of design parameters."

        "Answer": "Answer: d\nExplanation: Reinforced concrete (RC) is a composite material in which concrete’s relatively low tensile strength and ductility are counteracted by the inclusion of reinforcement having higher tensile strength or ductility. The reinforcement is usually, though not necessarily, steel reinforcing bars (rebar) and is usually embedded passively in the concrete before the concrete sets. Reinforcing schemes are generally designed to resist tensile stresses in particular regions of the concrete that might cause unacceptable cracking and/or structural failure. Modern reinforced concrete can contain varied reinforcing materials made of steel, polymers or alternate composite material in conjunction with rebar or not. Reinforced concrete may also be permanently stressed (in tension), so as to improve the behaviour of the final structure under working loads."

Block paving also known as brick paving is a commonly used decorative method of creating a pavement or hardstanding. The main benefit of bricks over other materials is that individual bricks can later be lifted up and replaced. This allows for remedial work to be carried out under the surface of the paving without leaving a lasting mark once the paving bricks have been replaced. Typical areas of use would be for driveways, pavement, patios, town centres, precincts and more commonly in road surfacing. Bricks are typically made of concrete or clay, though other composite materials are also used. Each has its own means of construction. The biggest difference is the way they set hard ready for use. A clay brick has to be fired in a kiln to bake the brick hard."

        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: d\nExplanation: The coning of wheels helps to keep the vehicle centrally aligned on a straight and level track also. Slight irregularities in the track do occur as a result of moving loads and the vagaries of the weather. The wheels, therefore, move from side to side and therefore the vehicles sway. Due to the coning of wheels, this side movement results in the tread circumference of one wheel increasing over the other. As both the wheels have to traverse the same distance, this causes one wheel to slide. Due to the resistance caused by the sliding, any further side movement is prevented."

        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: d\nExplanation: Addition due to infiltration-This is additional quantity due to groundwater seepage in to sewers through faulty joints or cracks formed in the pipes. The quantity of the water depends upon the height of the water table above the sewer invert level.\nAddition due to unaccounted private water supplies- People using water supply from private wells, tube wells, etc. contribute to the wastewater generation more than the water supplied by municipal authority. Similarly, certain industries utilize their own source of water.\nSubtraction due to water losses -The water loss, through leakage in water distribution system and house connections, does not reach consumers and hence, not appear as sewage.

            "d) Pipes laid in trenches, cutting through walls and pipes classified as per size"
        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: d\nExplanation: The product, delivered to the point of consumption, is called potable water if it meets the water quality standards required for human consumption.\nThe water in the supply network is maintained at positive pressure to ensure that water reaches all parts of the network, that a sufficient flow is available at every take-off point and to ensure that untreated water in the ground cannot enter the network. The water is typically pressurised by pumps that pump water into storage tanks constructed at the highest local point in the network. One network may have several such service reservoirs.\nIn small domestic systems, the water may be pressurised by a pressure vessel or even by an underground cistern (the latter however does need additional pressurizing). This eliminates the need of a water-tower or any other heightened water reserve to supply the water pressure."

        "Answer": "Answer: d\nExplanation: A fitting is used in pipe systems to connect straight pipe or tubing sections, adapt to different sizes or shapes and for other purposes, such as regulating (or measuring) fluid flow. “Plumbing” is generally used to describe the conveyance of water, gas, or liquid waste in domestic or commercial environments; “piping” is often used to describe the high-performance (high-pressure, high-flow, high-temperature or hazardous-material) conveyance of fluids in specialized applications. “Tubing” is sometimes used for lighter-weight piping, especially that flexible enough to be supplied in coiled form.\nFittings (especially uncommon types) require money, time, materials and tools to install, and are an important part of piping and plumbing systems. Valves are technically fittings but are usually discussed separately. "
