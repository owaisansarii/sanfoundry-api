        "Answer": "Answer: c\nExplanation: When the two complementary strands of DNA comes together in an aqueous solution the water molecules attached to the polynucleotide strands are displaced from the bases. This creates disorder and this increases the entropy. Therefore, it finally increases the stability of the DNA duplex."

        "Answer": "Answer: b\nExplanation: The core histone proteins are H2A, H2B, H3 and H4, over which the DNA is wrapped. Histone H1 is not a part of nucleosome core particle, instead it binds to the linker DNA and thus is referred to as linker histone. Thus, the histone core, linker histone and DNA are the components of the nucleosome."

            "d) H1 binds to two DNA helices at once"
        ],

            "d) Proteinacious in nature"
        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: b\nExplanation: Unlike the solenoid model, the zig-zag conformation requires the linker DNA to pass through the central axis of the fibre in a relatively straight form. Thus, longer linker DNA favors this conformation. Because the average linker DNA varies between species, the form of the 30 nm fibre may not always be the same."

        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: a\nExplanation: Core histones lacking their N – terminal tails are incapable of forming the 30 nm fibre. The tails is to stabilize the 30 nm fibre by interacting with adjacent nucleosomes. This model is supported by the three dimensional structure of the nucleosome., which shows that the amino terminal tails of H2A, H3 and H4 each interact with adjacent nucleosomes in the crystal lattice."

Presence of Topo II as a protein associated with the structure can be proved when the cells are treated with drugs which results in DNA breaks at the sites of Topo II DNA bindings. The treatment generates DNA fragments of about 50 kb size."

        "Answer": "Answer: d\nExplanation: Nucleosome positioning can be directed by DNA – binding protein or particular DNA sequences. Just as many proteins cannot bind to DNA within the nucleosome, prior binding of a protein to a site on DNA can prevent association of the core histone with that stretch of DNA. If two such DNA – binding proteins are bound to sites closer than the minimal nucleosomal DNA requirement (≈150 bp) the DNA stretch between the two proteins will remain nucleosome free."

G:C rich DNA has the opposite tendency thus, is favored when the major grove faces away from the histone octamer."

        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: a\nExplanation: The addition of a nucleotide to a growing polynucleotide chain of length n is indicated by the reaction: NTP + (NMP)n → (NMP)n+1 + P – P.\n But the free energy for this reaction is rather small. Additional free energy is provided by the rapid hydrolysis of the pyrophosphates into two phosphate groups (P – P → 2Pi). The net result of nucleotide and pyrophosphate hydrolysis is the breaking of two high – energy phosphate bonds. Therefore, DNA synthesis is known as a coupled process."

        "Answer": "Answer: d\nExplanation: Nonstop mediated decay rescues ribosomes that translate mRNAs that lack a stop codon. Eukaryotic mRNAs, due to tailing, terminate with a poly-A tail. When mRNA lacking a stop codon is translated it translates through the poly-A tail. This results in the addition of multiple lysines to the end of the protein thus stalling the ribosome at the end of the mRNA and thus triggering nonstop mediated decay."

Thus there are three more mechanisms that contribute to this specificity. In each case, these mechanisms select against incorrect codon-anticodon pairings."

        "Answer": "Answer: c\nExplanation: The activity of many proteins is regulated by covalent modifications. One example of this type of regulation is the activation of some enzymes by proteolytic cleavage of inactive precursors. Digestive enzymes and proteins involved in blood clotting and apoptosis are regulated in this mechanism."

Studies of mutants that were defective in regulation of these genes identified in two distinct loci, called o and i, which control the expression of the operon. Transcription of the operon is controlled by o, which is adjacent to the initiator site.
