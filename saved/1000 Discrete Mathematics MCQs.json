Each of these 8 pieces is put through an S-block which will output only 4-bits using non-linear-transformation.

In this scheme, both sender and receiver agree on a secret shift number for shifting the alphabet and this number lies between 0 and 25 becomes the key to the encryption.

However, as the boxes are identical, the two different ways of selecting which box holds the first two dolls and which one holds the second set of two dolls will look the same. Hence, we need to divide the result by 2. Therefore, total number of ways of achieving the 2, 2, 2, 1, 1 is = (8C2 * 6C2 * 4C2  * 1C1  * 1C1) / 2 = 1260."

A girl can pluck at least 0 oranges and the number of oranges plucks by each student is distinct. So, total number of plucked oranges should be less than 100. But 0+1+2…..+19+20 = 210>200  a contradiction.\nThus there exist two girls who plucked the same number of oranges. If thus there exist two girls who plucked the same number of oranges. It means each girl of remaining 18 students plucked different number of oranges. Number of oranges Plucked by 18 students = 0+1+2+3…+17 = 153 oranges. Number of oranges plucked by remaining 2 student = 200 – 153 = 47.  Both students plucked same number of oranges. So, Number of oranges plucked by one of them = 47/2=24."

            "d) 56549"
        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: b\nExplanation: There are 3 sisters and 8 other girls in total of 11 girls. The number of ways to arrange these 11 girls in a circular manner = (11– 1)! = 10!. These three sisters can now rearrange themselves in 3! ways. By the multiplication theorem, the number of ways so that 3 sisters always come together in the arrangement = 8! × 3!. Hence, the required number of ways in which the arrangement can take place if none of the 3 sisters is seated together: 10! – (8! × 3!) = 3628800 – (40320 * 6) = 3628800 – 241920 = 3386880."

At least one element has to occur exactly twice and that would leave 4 more places in the multiset means that at most four elements can occur exactly once. Thus there are two mutually exclusive cases as follows: 1) Exactly one element occurs exactly twice and select this element in n ways. Fill up the remaining four spots using 5 distinct elements from the remaining n−1 elements in n-1C4 ways. 2) Exactly four elements that occur at least once each.

To find a and b, set n=0 and n=1 to get a system of two equations with two unknowns: 4=a20+b180=a+b and 3=a21+b61=2a+6b. Solving this system gives b=-1/2 and a=7/2. So the solution to the recurrence relation is,\nan = 7/2*2n−1/2*6n."

Probability of first t-shirt being red = \\(\\frac{5}{13}\\).\nProbability of second t-shirt being red = \\(\\frac{4}{12}\\).\nSo: P(x1) = \\(\\frac{5}{13} × \\frac{4}{12} = \\frac{20}{146}\\). Likewise, for the probability of red first followed by black is \\(\\frac{8}{12}\\) (as there are 8 red t-shirts still in the drawer and 12 t-shirts all together).\nSo, P(x2) = \\(\\frac{5}{13} *\\frac{8}{12} = \\frac{40}{146}\\). Similarly for white then red: P(x3) = \\(\\frac{8}{13} × \\frac{4}{12} = \\frac{32}{146}\\).  Finally, for 2 black balls: P(x4) = \\(\\frac{8}{13} × \\frac{7}{12} = \\frac{56}{146}\\).

Here relation given is set containment, so supremum element will be just union of all sets in the subset we choose.

So number of vertices having odd degrees must be even, otherwise, their sum would have been odd, making total degree also odd. Now single vertex n is connected to all these even number of vertices (which have odd degrees). So, degree of n is also even. Moreover, now degree of all vertices which are connected to v is increased by 1, hence earlier vertices which had odd degree now have even degree.

For n=10, we can choose the first edge in 10C2 = 45 ways, second in 8C2=28 ways, third in 6C2=15 ways and so on. So, the total number of ways 45*28*15*6*1=113400.

A graph of vertices with zero degrees don’t belong to Eulerian Cycle or Path, b) If two vertices have odd degree and all other vertices have even degree. Thus, the time to find whether a graph has a Eulerian path or not is O(V+E) with V vertices and E edges."

            "d) inverse and closure"
        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: b\nExplanation: Closure for all a, b∈G, the result of the operation, a+b, is also in G. Since there is one element, hence a=b=0, and a+b=0+0=0∈G. Hence, closure property is satisfied. Associative for all a, b, c∈G, (a+b)+c=a+(b+c). For example, a=b=c=0. Hence (a+b)+c=a+(b+c)\n⟹(0+0)+0=0+(0+0)⟹0=0. Hence, associativity property is satisfied. Suppose for an element e∈G such that, there exists an element a∈G and so the equation e+a=a+e=a holds. Such an element is unique, the identity element property is satisfied. For example, a=e=0. Hence e+a = a+e⟹0+0=0+0⟹0=a. Hence e=0 is the identity element. For each a∈G, there exists an element b∈G (denoted as a-1), such that a+b=b+a=e, where e is the identity element. The inverse element is 0 as the addition of 0 with 0 will be 0, which is also an identity element of the structure."
