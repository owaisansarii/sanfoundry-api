        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: a\nExplanation: A major improvement in the man-machine interface is the HUD system. The major advantage in HUD is that the pilot is able to view and assimilate the important flight data parameters whilst head up and maintaining full visual concentration to the outside world. The area at which the flight parameters are displayed is only on the transparent display panel thus the pilot does not have a 360° display."

        "Options": [
            "a) More information can be displayed",

            "d) Fast screen refresh rates"
        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: c\nExplanation: A collimated display is a display in which the rays of light emitted/reflected is parallel to the display. Since the rays of light are parallel, its focus is at infinity, thus the pilot is able to view the information on the HUD without changing his focus from the outside world scene without parallax error. Also, the ray of light from a collimated display would not disperse with distance."

        "Answer": "Answer: a\nExplanation: The symbols and flight parameters are generated and magnified by the CRT (Cathode Ray Tube) and is reflected almost 90° by a mirror. The reflected rays are passed through a collimating lens which produces a parallel ray of light with focus at infinity. The collimated rays are then displayed in a combiner glass which combines the outside world picture with the flight parameters generated to be viewed by the pilot."

        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: c\nExplanation: The FOV of an HMD is 360° in the sense that the pilot can look around(by moving his head) in all direction and still view the flight parameters in his line of sight.

        "Answer": "Answer: c\nExplanation: The geometry of the cockpit does not affect the HMD nor the helmet as the helmet is worn by the pilot and the FOV of the HMD moves with the pilot’s head. Some of the factors that are essential are the minimum weight for comfort while wearing the helmet for long flight hours and in high g maneuvers, crashworthiness of the helmet with HMD and communication systems integrated no interference with other objects in the cockpit such as oxygen mask as it is crucial at ejection at high speeds."

        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: a\nExplanation: 800grams = 0.8 kg, during a 9g turn the pilot will experience a gravitational force 9 times that of a normal person at Earth surface. The total weight felt by the pilot = 0.8 x 9 = 7.2kg. Typical HMD helmets weigh around 1kg and at 9g the weight felt by the pilot will be 9kg which is just acceptable."

            "d) Reduce the moment of inertia about yaw and pitch axis"
        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: c\nExplanation: Keeping the head always in an upright position is not an option for pilots since the pilot will lose situational awareness if he does so. The pilot will feel the inertial forces irrespective of his head position. By reducing the moment of inertia we can reduce the inertial torques experienced. Reducing weight and positioning the CG of the helmet with the pivoting point of head ensures that there are minimal out of balance moments. "

The pilot can look at the enemy aircraft and lock on to it. The relative position of the enemy is then calculated by the head position of the pilot and sent to missiles to engage the target.

        "Answer": "Answer: b\nExplanation: An aircraft is said to be negatively stable when its tailplane produces positive\nlift. The tail of an aircraft without an FBW system must always produce negative lift to maintain stability and to keep the nose up. Since it produces negative lift, it actually acts in the direction of weight reducing aerodynamic efficiency. In an FBW equipped aircraft a positive lift producing tail can be used by using flight control computers and motion sensors to main stability at all times."

Such a condition is called steady level flight. A highly stable aircraft will return to its initial stable position even if disturbed. Maneuverability is the rate of pitch, roll, and yaw an aircraft can execute without failing.

        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: c\nExplanation: The incidence terms from the airstream sensors can be blended with the pitch rate error terms and the ‘gearings’ (or gain coefficients) of these terms adjusted as higher angles of attack are approached. This enables the angle of incidence to be kept within the safe limits whilst maneuvering at high angles of incidence, i.e., the angle of incidence limiting. "

The mean time between failures, or MTBF, of a single channel FBW system is in the region of 3,000 hours. The FBW system must thus possess redundancy with multiple parallel channels so that it is able to survive at least two failures if these very low failure probability figures are to be met. "

These commands are generally attitude commands which operate the aircraft’s control surfaces through a closed flight control loop system so that the aircraft rotates about the pitch and roll axes until the measured pitch and bank angles are equal to the commanded angles.

The FMS computed position is an optimum combination of the inertial position and the GPS or radio position, depending on which equipment provides the most accurate data. This results in four navigation modes: Inertial (IRS) – GPS, Inertial (IRS) – DME/DME, Inertial (IRS) – VOR/DME, Inertial (IRS) only. The only GPS is not used as the position information is within a radius where the aircraft is flying."

Although direct coupling to the bus is allowed, this is generally not used in order to avoid the risk of one terminal shorting out the bus. The bus connection is typically via a transformer coupled stub so that shorting of the stub is isolated from the bus."

            "d) Less power consumption"
        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: a\nExplanation: LNA or low noise amplifier is placed in between the antenna and the mixer. The oscillator signal is relatively strong and some of it can leak through and appear at the input of the mixer. The RF amplifier between the mixer and the antenna isolates the two, significantly reducing any local oscillator radiation."

One way of doing this is to use low-power transmissions so that the signals do not interfere with one another. When very low power is used, the signals do not travel very far. The transmission distance is a function of the power level, frequency, and antenna height."

        "Answer": "Answer: c\nExplanation: When the noise affects the transmission, its effect is on both the wires but since they are 180° out of phase when the signal reaches the receiver the noise gets cancelled out. This is called common-mode rejection, and noise reduction can be as great as 60 to 70 dB."

        ],
        "Answer": " Answer: a\nExplanation: When a vertical antenna is made less than one-quarter wavelength, the practical effect is a decreased inductance. The antenna no longer resonates at the desired operating frequency, but at a higher frequency. To compensate for this, a series inductor, called a loading coil, is connected in series with the antenna coil. The loading coil brings the antenna back into resonance at the desired frequency."

Because there is a voltage null at the center of a one-half wavelength conductor at the resonant frequency, there is no potential difference between the elements and so they can all be connected to a conducting boom with no undesirable effect. In other words, the elements are not “shorted together.”"

        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: b\nExplanation: Military aircraft usually wish to have a very low RCS or radar cross section so that they are stealthy and undetectable on the enemy’s primary radar. RCS can be reduced by various methods like using radar energy absorbing materials on the surface of the aircraft and not having sharp corners on the aircraft which are more likely to reflect radio energy back to the radar antenna."
