        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: d\nExplanation: Infrared waves are heat radiations also known as heatwaves. These waves are produced by hot bodies and molecules. They do heating because water molecules present in most of the materials readily absorb infrared waves and their thermal motion increases, so they heat themselves and also heat their surroundings.\n"

Even though X-rays have higher energy than light waves and can pass through the body, it is not of great value in the early diagnosis of pathological conditions of bones and joints like tuberculosis. This is because, in the early stages of the disease, the damage to the lungs may not yet have become sufficiently marked in the X-ray to be detectable, so people who have active tuberculosis can be missed.\n"

        "Question": "Which one of the following is a way to produce a signal?",
        "Options": [
            "a) Superimposition with a carrier signal",
            "b) Superimposition with a received signal",
            "c) Superimposition with a transmitted signal",
            "d) No superimposition is required"
        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: a\nExplanation: Any signal that is generated from a source and is required to be sent over large distances from the source to the receiver, needs to be modified. This can be achieved by superimposition with a carrier signal in order to ensure that the signal is transmitted in a suitable bandwidth.\n"

        "Question": "Which of the following is true about carrier signal?",
        "Options": [
            "a) Carrier signals have low frequency",
            "b) Carrier signals are used to increase the wavelength of the signal",
            "c) Carrier signals have high frequency",
            "d) Carrier signals and message signals are the same"
        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: c\nExplanation: Carrier signals have high frequencies and hence are used in the transmission of radio waves. This is because since space is an insulator, for having electric current in order to magnetize it is only possible if the source contains a rate of change of voltage or a varying electric field. All the other statements are not valid.\n"

        "Options": [
            "a) Square law device",
            "b) Rectifier",
            "c) Bandpass filter",
            "d) Combination of message and carrier signal"
        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: b\nExplanation: Rectifier is not involved in the process of production of the amplitude-modulated wave. When the message signal is superimposed with the carrier signal to form the desired signal, that signal is in one phase only. So, to overcome this problem we use a square-law device placed in the circuit to square the waveform generated. Bandpass filters are also used in the process.\n"

        "Options": [
            "a) Bandpass filters filter out the unwanted frequencies",
            "b) The transmitting antenna transmits the signal over large distances",
            "c) Attenuation should be reduced for a signal",
            "d) The modulated signal is quite strong"
        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: a\nExplanation: Yes, this is a true statement. A bandpass filter rejects low and high frequencies and allows a band of frequencies to pass through. So, when a signal is passed through a bandpass filter, it rejects dc and the sinusoids of frequencies ωm, 2ωm, and 2ωc and retains the frequencies ωc, ωc – ωm, and ωc + ωm.The output of the bandpass filter, therefore, is of the same form is hence an AM wave.\n"

            "d) Immediate frequency"
        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: a\nExplanation: Intermediate frequency (IF) is a frequency to which a carrier wave is shifted as an intermediate step during the transmission of a signal in order to facilitate further processing. In this, the carrier frequency is usually changed to a lower frequency preceding the detection.\n"

        "Answer": "Answer: c\nExplanation: The amplifier is a part of the receiver system, of which, the detector is a part of. But, the detector system alone consists of the rectifier, envelope detector, and obviously the amplitude-modulated wave that passes through it.\n"

            "d) Transmission"
        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: b\nExplanation: Detection is the process of recovering the modulating signal from the modulated carrier wave. The transmitted message gets attenuated in propagating through the channel. The receiving antenna is, therefore, to be followed by an amplifier and a detector. The detected signal may not be strong enough to be made use of and hence is required to be amplified.\n"

            "d) High frequency AM waves"
        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: a\nExplanation: Yes, this is a true statement. A rectifier converts alternating current (AC), which periodically reverses its direction, to direct current, which travels only in one direction. In a communication system, the modulated signal coming from the intermediate frequency (IF) stage is passed through the rectifier, located in the detector system, and the rectifier, in turn, produces the output required.\n"
