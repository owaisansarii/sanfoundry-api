Irreversible inhibition behaves as time-dependent loss of enzyme concentration, when the enzyme is totally inactive.

This will leads to aggregation of enzymes to form precipitates. The complete procedure is carried out at low temperatures to avoid denaturation of enzymes. Precipitation and chromatography are the steps involved in enzyme purification.\n"

Immobilization does not always mean immobile; it means confining an enzyme to a confined space. This may be achieved by fixing the enzyme, to or within, some other material. Enzyme kinetics is referred to as study of rates of chemical reactions that are catalyzed by enzymes. Biosensors are analytical devices which convert biological response into an electrical signal. Enzyme inhibition is referred to as the process in which the rate of an enzyme catalyzed reaction is reduced.\n"

        "Answer": "Answer: a\nExplanation: Enzyme use in detergent industry is cost effective and safe due to the development of a dust free granulate with an inner core containing enzyme, inorganic salts and sugars as preservative bound with carboxymethyl cellulose fibers or similar protective colloid. This is then coated with inert waxy material made of paraffin oil/ polyethylene glycol with various hydrophobic binders, which later disperse in wash. This prevents dust formation and protects enzyme against damage during storage. Hence the statement is true.\n"

There should be a distinction made between the more hydrophilic enzymes and the more hydrophobic enzymes which is often associated with lipid and membranes. The stability of hydrophilic enzymes depends on the presence of a thin layer of water within the microenvironment. This amount of water is minimal and can be said that the enzyme is operating in an almost anhydrous state effectively. Hydrophobic lipases retain its activity even if fewer molecules of water are remaining, assuming that it is just sufficient to stabilize the conformation of the active site.\n"

        "Answer": "Answer: a\nExplanation: In biphasic systems, there is a pH of minute pools of water which contain no free hydrogen ions. Hence, it is impossible to measure or control the pH directly. But, the enzyme is said to ‘remember’ the pH of its last aqueous solution and functions as though it maintaining the same pH. If the enzyme-bound water is diluted by the use of the more water-soluble organic solvents, then the enzyme is usually inactivated. Under the conditions where this does not occur, the limited amount of water available, and the associated reduced water activity reduces the rate of thermoinactivation. Hence the above statement is true.\n"

Lower solvent polarity has lesser capacity to disrupt the structure of the necessary tightly bound water molecules. The best measure of solvent polarity is the logarithm of the partition coefficient. For the use of biphasic systems in many enzyme-catalyzed reactions, the important factor to be addressed is stability of the enzyme.

It shows a clear correlation between the activity of biocatalysts in two-phase systems and the Log P as a S-shaped curve. This plot suggests that enzymes are generally inactivated by solvents with log P < 2, but are little affected by solvents with Log P > 4. There is some variation in the effects between different enzymes and different solvents which makes activity prediction rather imprecise between 2 – 4 of log P. The range 2 – 4 includes some of the most utilized organic phases which may be suitable for some and harmful in others. The solubility of the reactants and products may considerably reduce the range of log P that are available for a particular application because many basically nonpolar molecules possessing some polar structural regions cause lack of solubility in strongly hydrophobic solvents.\n"

        "Answer": "Answer: a\nExplanation: In biphasic systems, reactants may have fairly low aqueous solubilities under normal conditions. The aqueous phase remains effectively unstirred, while the organic phase is well-stirred so that the thickness of the ‘unstirred layer’ (δ) is equal to the thickness of the aqueous layer surrounding the enzyme.\n• When δ is large, it leads to the passage of reactants through aqueous layer due to formation concentration gradient which will be very shallow. This the result of the reactants being less soluble in water.\n• If δ is small, the enzyme is freely soluble, causing the reactants from the more concentrated organic phase through the interphase boundary to very low concentrations within the microenvironment of the enzyme.\nThis shows that the thickness of the aqueous layer around an immobilized enzyme is important and determines the degree of diffusional resistance involved. Thus, lowering the reaction rate. Hence the above statement is true.\n"

        "Answer": "Answer: a\nExplanation: Aspartame is a high intensity sweetener and a dipeptide of L-aspartic acid and methyl ester of L-phenylalanine. The procedure of synthesis of aspartame must have the capability to protect the β-carboxyl group and the α-amino group of the L-aspartic acid. If thermolysin is used to catalyze production of aspartame, the regio-specificity of the enzyme helps eliminating the need to protect β-carboxyl group of L-aspartic acid. But the α-amino group must still be protected to prevent the synthesis of poly-L-aspartic acid. Hence the above statement is true.\n"

After this step, the BOC-aspartame is released from this adduct by simply altering the pH. The stereo-specificity of the thermolysin determines that only the L-isomer of phenylalanine methyl ester reacts but the addition product is formed equally well from both the D- and L-isomers.\n"

Enzymes may be redesigned to fit more appropriately into industrial processes, as in case of glucose isomerase which is made less susceptible to inhibition by the Ca2+ present in the starch saccharification processing stream. Subtilisin has been aimed at the improvement of its activity in detergents by stabilizing it at even higher temperatures, pH and oxidant strength. Trypsin has an active site closely related to that of subtilisin and hence genetic engineering in trypsin gives the predictable result of abolishing the activity against its normal substrates, but unpredictably gives no activity against substrates where these basic residues are replaced by aspartic acid or glutamic acid.\n"

        "Answer": "Answer: a\nExplanation: Proteolysis is the main reason for enzyme inactivation by microbial contamination. It may occur if proteases are present in the living cell. When the enzymes are in their native form, they are resistant to attack by proteases because of highly structured domains which lower the bonds available for protease attack. Protease may produce single nicks that have little effect of protein conformation and hence the activity.\n"
