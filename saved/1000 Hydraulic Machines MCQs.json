        "Options": [
            "a) Kinetic energy to hydrodynamic energy",
            "b) Hydrodynamic energy to kinetic energy",
            "c) Mechanical energy to kinetic energy",
            "d) Mechanical energy to Hydrodynamic energy"
        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: d\nExplanation: Gear pumps are used to transport fluids. They transport fluids by conversion of energies. A gear pump uses meshing of gears. This meshing is done to pump fluid by displacement. Gear pumps are widely used in chemical installations."

        "Question": "The rotational kinetic energy comes from ______",
        "Options": [
            "a) Engine motor",

            "d) Draft tube"
        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: a\nExplanation: When there is an increase in the load, the energy in the turbine is drained off. Thus, to increase the energy, the by pass valve is opened to increase the amount of fresh steam entry. This increases the energy in the turbine."
