This is because all of them have the property of electron transfer or we can say the movement of a pair of electrons from an electron rich site (a lone pair of electrons or a bond) to an electron poor site. But revolution of bond will not lead to movement of electron between compounds."

        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: d\nExplanation: Alkyl halides are considered to be very reactive compounds towards nucleophile because they have an electrophilic carbon & a good leaving group as we go down the periodic table, halides that are larger in size will also be able to distribute their charge over a larger volume, making them less reactive (less basic). This is why fluoride is a much poorer leaving group than any of the other halides. So, alkyl halides are good for nucleophilic substitution reactions."

        "Answer": "Answer: d\nExplanation: Reaction of HX with alcohol depends on the degree of carbonation generated due to heterocyclic cleavage of HX bond. If alcohol is primary alcohol then reaction will proceed through Sn2 for tertiary alcohol it will proceed with Sn1. For secondary alcohol it can go through both path (Sn1 or Sn2).  Sn1 being ionic in nature takes place very fast while Sn2 is molecular in nature reacts slowly. Hence, we can sum up above, Rate of reaction is 3° alcohol > 2° alcohol > 1° alcohol."

            "d) Ethyl alcohol shows hydrogen bonding"
        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: d\nExplanation: Alcohols have much higher boiling points than the comparable alkanes or the related ethers because molecules of alcohols can interact through hydrogen bonding while those of alkanes and ethers cannot. Thus, Ethanol has a higher boiling point (78℃) than dimethyl ether (−25℃) though they have the same molecular weight. "

        "Answer": "Answer: c\nExplanation: In the industrial preparation of ethylene glycol, ethylene (IUPAC name: ethene) is oxidized to ethylene oxide (IUPAC name: oxirane) using oxygen and a silver catalyst. Ethylene oxide is then reacted with water at high temperature or in the presence of an acid catalyst to produce ethylene glycol. Diethylene glycol is a useful by-product of this process.\n<img src=\"https://www.sanfoundry.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/organic-chemistry-questions-answers-preaprations-glycols-q2.png\" alt=\"organic-chemistry-questions-answers-preaprations-glycols-q2\" width=\"386\" height=\"66\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-224498\" srcset=\"https://www.sanfoundry.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/organic-chemistry-questions-answers-preaprations-glycols-q2.png 386w, https://www.sanfoundry.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/organic-chemistry-questions-answers-preaprations-glycols-q2-300x51.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 386px) 100vw, 386px\" />"

        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: a\nExplanation: Amongst aldehydes and ketones, ketones have higher boiling point. This is due to the presence of two electron donating alkyl groups around the group which makes them more polar. As dipole moment is greater so it is more polar and hence has higher boiling point. However, the aldehyde’s boiling point isn’t as high as the alcohol’s. In the alcohol, there is hydrogen bonding as well as the other two kinds of intermolecular attraction. "

Therefore, the descending order of all four of the provided compounds is butanoic acid, 2-hexanone, 2-pentanone then 3-methyl-2-butanone.

        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: a\nExplanation: Basicity of amines increase with increase in number of −CH3 groups (or any group which cause +I effect), due to increase in electron density on N atom. As a rule, the basicity of 3° amine should be more than that of 2° amine, but actually it is found to be lesser than 2° amines. This is due to more solvation by water in secondary amine. Hence the correct order of basicity is: (CH3)2NH > (CH3)3N > CH3NH2."

        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: c\nExplanation: Aniline react by initially attacking the carbonyl carbon (benzaldehyde), followed by hydrogen transfers to give an amine where the nitrogen is bonded to a carbon that also contains a hydroxy group. Under acidic conditions, the hydroxyl group is protonated, followed by loss of water to give the conjugate acid of the observed product(imine). Hydrogen ion transfer then gives the Schiff base product.  The condensation step to give water is acid catalyzed and is the rate-determining step of the sequence."

        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: c\nExplanation: In water,bromine is ionised up to greater extent to form large number of bromonium ions.Hence Br+ ions attack on aniline from either side to form 2,4,6,-tribromoaniline. In order to obtain monobromo aniline, reaction is carried out in presence of acetic acid. In glacial acetic acid, bromine is ionised to lesser extent and hence relatively less number of bromonium ions are formed.Thus interference of water is ceased."
