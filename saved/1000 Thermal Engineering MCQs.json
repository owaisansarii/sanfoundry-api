Since the water inside the boiler is converted into steam, the fire for converting is fuelled by burning the coal which produces high amount of fly ash, so that the ash’ can be reused. The use of electrostatic precipitators is growing rapidly because of the new strict air code and environmental laws. An electrostatic can be designed to operate at any desired efficiency.  "

        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: d\nExplanation: Make-up water is added to compensate for the losses of water incurred by blow downs or leakages occurring in boiler, and also to maintain desired water level in boiler steam drum. Blow down and leakages are common since there is continuous flow of condensate from condenser to boiler."

        "Answer": "Answer: b\nExplanation: The liquid coming from the expansion valve is converted into vapor and forwarded to the compressor for compression. So, the evaporator absorbs the heat, and phase change occurs. There is a slight change in pressure but negligible. Thus, the state of refrigerant changes from low-pressure liquid to low-pressure vapor."

        "Answer": "Answer: d\nExplanation: Capacity of the evaporator is the amount of heat absorbed by it over a given period of time. Increase in the velocity can increase the heat transfer up to a certain extent. The thickness of the coil wall affects the convection, and hence capacity can be changed. The material should be a good conductor to get optimum heat transfer. Hence, evaporator pressure does not affect the capacity, but the temperature does have."
