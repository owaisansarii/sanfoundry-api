        "Options": [
            "a) Each CMOS input gate has a specific propagation time and this limits the number of different gates that can be connected to the output of a CMOS gate",
            "b) When the frequency reaches the critical value the gate will only be capable of delivering 70% of the normal output voltage and consequently the output power will be one-half of normal and this defines the upper operating frequency",
            "c) The higher number of gates attached to the output the more frequently they will have to be serviced thus reducing the frequency at which each will be serviced with an input signal",
            "d) The input gates of the FETs are predominantly capacitive and as the signal frequency increases the capacitive loading also increases thereby limiting the number of loads that may be attached to the output of the driving gate"

        "Answer": "Answer: c\nExplanation: Half adders have only two inputs A and B. When we add two 4 bit binary number like 0001 and 0011, then half adder can not be used because if the first bit of both the numbers is 1, then the sum would be 0 and carry would be 1. But this carry can not be added with the second bits addition of the number. So, half adders are useless. But in full adders, one more carry input is present, so that, if carry of one stage is present, it can be added with the next stage as it is done in normal addition. So, therefore, full adders have a carry input capability."

        "Answer": "Answer: b\nExplanation: Surface-mount technology (SMT) is a method for producing electronic circuits in which the components are mounted or placed directly onto the surface of printed circuit boards (PCBs). An electronic device so made is called a surface-mount device (SMD). In the industry, it has largely replaced the through-hole technology construction method of fitting components with wire leads into holes in the circuit board. Both technologies can be used on the same board for components not suited to surface mounting such as large transformers and heat-sinked power semiconductors."

Therefore, an even-parity input to an EX-OR gate produces a low output, while an odd parity input produces a high output. While, in case of AND, it produces high output when all inputs are 1 else low. Whereas, NAND, does the opposite, by producing low output when all inputs are 1 else high."
