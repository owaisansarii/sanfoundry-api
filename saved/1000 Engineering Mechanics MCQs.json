        "Answer": "Answer: c\nExplanation: The net force of the body is zero that doesn’t mean that the force are not being applied to the body at all and hence the body is in equilibrium. The equilibrium is only attained if the net force on the body tends to be equal to zero. Thus the forces cancels out. If this happens there is no motion of the body along any direction and hence the body is said to be in equilibrium. "

        "Answer": "Answer: d\nExplanation: The summation of the forces needs to be zero. So does the summation of the moments need to zero. But talking about the angles, they not need to zero. But the forces which are acting at particular angles, must needed to be equal to zero. The basic need of the forces to make the body in equilibrium."

        "Answer": "Answer: b\nExplanation: The free body diagrams does play an important role in the formation of the conditions of the equilibrium of the rigid body. As the net forces are zero, the fbd helps us to take the measure of the same. That is to see whether the summation is really zero or not."

        "Answer": "Answer: c\nExplanation: The net moment of the body is zero that doesn’t mean that the distance between the force and the rotational axis is zero. This means moments caused by different forces cancels out. If this happens there is no motion of the body along any direction and hence the body is said to be in equilibrium."

        "Answer": "Answer: a\nExplanation: The negative sign implies things in the opposite manner. If the force is coming negative this doesn’t means that it is impossible. But it means that the force is in the opposite direction w.r.t the direction set by you in the free body diagram."
