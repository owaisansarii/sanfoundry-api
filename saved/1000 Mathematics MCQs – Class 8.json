        "Answer": "Answer: a\nExplanation: Let us take the two digit number such that the digit in the units place is x. The digit in tens place differs by 4 ∴ the digit in tens place is (x + 4).\n∴the two digit number obtained = [10 * (x + 4)] + [x] \n∴the two digit number obtained = 10x + 40 + x\n∴the two digit number obtained = 11x + 40\nWhen the digits are interchanged we obtain the number = [10 * x] + [(x + 4)] \nThe new number obtained = 11x + 4\nAs we know the original number and the new number add up to 152.\n∴ [11x + 40] + [11x + 4] = 152\n∴ 22x + 44 = 152\n∴ 22x = 110\n∴ x = 5\nThe original number = [10 * ( x + 4 )] + [x] \nThe original number = 11x + 40\nThe original number = 11 * (5) + 40\nThe original number = 55 + 40\nThe original number = 95.\n"

        "Options": [
            "a) 3.347 × 10-27",
            "b) 3.337 × 10-27",

            "d) 3.357 × 10-27"
        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: a\nExplanation: Total mass = mass of neutron + mass of proton = 1.675 × 10-27 + 1.672 × 10-27 = (1.675 + 1.672) × 10-27 = 3.347 × 10-27.\n"

        "Options": [
            "a) V1 = 800V2",
            "b) V1 = 8000V2",

            "d) V2 = 800V1"
        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: c\nExplanation: Distance between B and C = AC – AB = 2.1 × 1011 – 3.12 × 109 = (2.1 + 0.0312) × 1011 = 2.1312 × 1011.\n"
