        "Options": [
            "a) Vapor bubbles are formed when the fluid pressure goes above the vapor pressure and collapses when the fluid pressure goes above the bubble pressure",
            "b) Vapor bubbles are formed when the fluid pressure goes above the vapor pressure and collapses when the fluid pressure goes below the bubble pressure",

        "Answer": "Answer: a\nExplanation: When a torque is applied to a fluid particle, it undergoes a rotation. Thus, the rotation of a fluid particle will alwayds be associated with shear stress. Shear stress is in turn dependent on the viscosity. Hence, rotational flow occurs where the viscosity effects are predominant. Since, viscosity effects are predominant inside the blundary layer, the flow will be rotational in this region. However, outside the boundary layer, the viscosity effects are negligible.

For Re < 2000, the flow will be laminar and Re > 4000, the ow will be turbulent. For laminar flow, the viscosity effects must be high (μ should be high) as inside the boundary layer.
