MATLAB won’t understand sin(x)=1 as an equation until we initialise x as a symbolic variable. syms x;eqn = cos(x) == 1/2;vpa( solve(eqn,x)) would’ve generated the same answer but it has 3 lines while vpa(solve(‘cos(x)=1/2’)) has only 1 line.

If the result of the latter is the transpose of the former, it suggests that a=bT. This is because element-wise division is performed by the operator ‘./’.

            "a) Using anonymous functions or inline functions",

            "d) Using any function"
        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: b\nExplanation: The function str2cat() returns floating point or decimal expressions for integer values or fractional values. Anonymous functions and inline return decimal values for fractional values but not for integer values. Hence, str2cat is preferable. "

        "Answer": "Answer: a\nExplanation: Persistent variables help to retain the value which has been produced by a sub-function. They are local to the sub-function but MATLAB reserves permanent storage for them so they might seem like global variables. They are never shown in the workspace so they differ from global variables."

        "Answer": "Answer: d\nExplanation: Any global variable, in the primary function, if required to be accessed by a nested function- the variable needs to be declared with the global keyword within the function which requires access to it. This allows sharing the variable amongst the primary and other functions. If the variable is declared without using the global keyword, the variable might bring an error to the function."

        "Answer": "Answer: c\nExplanation: When we have many functions nested in a primary function, it is a good practice to place comment lines which would help anybody to understand the purpose of the function- making the function more versatile.

All other comment lines after or preceding the function definition won’t be returned as H1 line when the H1 line is sought in MATLAB."

There is no error in logic.\nOutput: No output will be shown since we have placed a semi-colon after j=j+i. But the workspace will store i & j as 1 & 0 respectively."

So the tendency of every point in the curve has to follow a radian frequency and not a step frequency. Here the frequency of time is stepping up by 1, so the sine curve will only consist of 11 values, which will lead to the sine curve appearing to be broken.\nOutput:  <img src=\"https://www.sanfoundry.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/matlab-questions-answers-fine-tuning-q5.png\" alt=\"matlab-questions-answers-fine-tuning-q5\" width=\"259\" height=\"205\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-231176\" srcset=\"https://www.sanfoundry.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/matlab-questions-answers-fine-tuning-q5.png 259w, https://www.sanfoundry.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/matlab-questions-answers-fine-tuning-q5-100x80.png 100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 259px) 100vw, 259px\" />   "

Now even though we have the index i=1 in the workspace, it will get cleared from it but the loop will continue with i=1. So the final value of y will be y=5+1=6.

But for a homogeneous system with no constant value, it will yield a 0 as a solution. Hence all the variables will get a 0 as a solution, there-by yielding a trivial solution. This doesn’t imply that the system is inconsistent- this is why we go for comparing ranks, it will allow us to establish a more pertinent justification of the nature of the system."

Rest are incorrect because the two conditions of removal discontinuity is limn→n0 f(n) < ∞  and f(n0) < ∞. So the function should have equal values while reaching the limiting value from both directions and it should have a finite value at the limiting value.

        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: a\nExplanation: The sorting procedure is the easiest way to get the highest of n numbers. This is because the code complexity will increase, drastically, if we use an if-else structure or a switch-case structure. "

        ],

This way of giving input is not possible since the impulse command generates a graph and we are really giving a graph as an input to the command which leads to an error. Although, the impulse command generates a step function and the step response of a step function is a ramp function- here there will be an error."

The cut-off frequency for allowing signals is 3Hz but the given signal frequency is that of 2Hz only. If the frequency of the signal generator was more than 2Hz- the output would’ve been entire signal at the same frequency but for >>3Hz. Now, the convolution in time domain is multiplication in frequency domain and the output of the transfer function block is the product of the transfer function and the laplace transform of the sinusoid. It can be checked in MATLAB that the poles of the resultant function will consist of one pole at s=-2+(-).707i which equivalently suggest that there is a 3 db decade if the input frequency becomes less than 2hz."

So if they get multiplied, the output can be the response of a system- provided one of the transfer function is the impulse response of a system while the other is just a representation of some signal. Now, this means that the poles of each function is provided in the second row vector of tf() command. This means the pole can possibly be at s=-4/3 since the elements indicate increasing power of s from left to right."
