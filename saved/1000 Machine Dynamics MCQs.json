        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: a\nExplanation: Transient response of control system means changing so, this occurs mainly after two conditions and these two conditions are\n1. Just after switching ‘on’ the system that means at the time of application of an input signal to the system.\n2. Just after any abnormal conditions. Abnormal conditions may include sudden change in the load, short circuiting etc."
