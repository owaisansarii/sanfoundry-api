        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: c\nExplanation: Centrifugal pump is not a positive displacement pump. Reciprocating pumps move liquid by means of a constant back-and-forth motion of a piston, plunger, or diaphragm within a fixed volume or cylinder. Reciprocating pumps can handle viscous and abrasive fluids. They are low-speed machines when compared with centrifugal and rotary."

        "Answer": "Answer: b\nExplanation: The capacity of a pump has two components, the pump discharge rate and the discharge pressure. The discharge rate is normally measured in gallons per minute (gpm) in English units or liters per second (lps) in metric units. Discharge capacity of the reciprocating pump is less that of the centrifugal pump."

        "Answer": "Answer: c\nExplanation: Most pumps are not self-priming. In other words, the pump casing must be filled with liquid before the pump is started, or the pump will not be able to function. In case the pump casing gets filled with vapors or gases, the pump impeller becomes gas-bound and incapable of pumping."

        "Answer": "Answer: b\nExplanation: Liquid-ring pumps for the dairy industry are used where the product contains large quantities of air or gas, and where centrifugal pumps therefore cannot be used. The clearances between impeller and casing are small, and this type of pump is therefore not suitable for handling abrasive products."

            "d) Peristaltic pumps"
        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: d\nExplanation: In Peristaltic pumps, during rotation, the medium (liquid or gas) inside the hose is transported to the lower outlet connection. This creates a vacuum on the suction side, and the product is drawn into the pump.

When fluid flows inside a pipeline, friction occurs between the moving fluid and the stationary pipe wall. The friction converts some of the fluid’s hydraulic energy into thermal energy. The thermal energy cannot be converted back to hydraulic energy, so the fluid experiences a drop in pressure. This conversion and loss of energy is known as head loss. "
