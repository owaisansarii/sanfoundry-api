        "Answer": "Answer: b\nExplanation: Homogeneity refers to uniformity in composition, which is a characteristic property of crystalline solids. Isotropy is when the values of physical properties do not change with direction throughout the body of the solid. Crystalline solids are anisotropic because the composition of the solid changes with direction, hence the physical properties also change with direction.\n"

        "Answer": "Answer: a\nExplanation: Nitrogen atom does not exhibit allotropy. This is because of its relatively small size and high inter-electronic repulsion due to which the N – N becomes extremely weak. However, theoretically there are two predicted forms of allotropes of nitrogen. First, alpha nitrogen assumes a cubic structure and exists only below 35.6 K which is a whooping -237.55°C. Beta nitrogen exists from 35.6 K to 63.15 K. After that, it melts.\n"

White phosphorus is made up of discrete P4 tetrahedra which are subjected to very high angular strain as the angles is 60 degrees. This high angular strain makes white phosphorus unstable and highly reactive.\n"

Due to small size and high electronegativity, oxygen atom forms pπ – pπ double bond with other oxygen atom to form O = O molecule. The intermolecular forces of attraction between oxygen molecules are weak van der Waals forces and hence oxygen exists as a diatomic gas at room temperature.\n"

        "Answer": "Answer: c\nExplanation: Aldehydes and ketones have a polar CO group which also has a double bond. The incoming nucleophile attacks the sp2 hybridised carbon, thus breaking the double bond and converting it into sp3, and forming a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate. This undergoes another fast step to form an addition product.\n"

        "Answer": "Answer: a\nExplanation: Aliphatic amines are stronger bases than ammonia and hence have a much lower pKb than ammonia.

        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: b\nExplanation: In the gaseous state, the solvation effect is missing and hence the expected order of basicity will be 3° > 2° > 1°.

        "Answer": "Answer: d\nExplanation: This peculiar order of basic strength is due to a combination of inductive, solvation and stearic effects of the alkyl groups in the amines. In methyl substituted amines, the solvation effect superimposes the inductive effect to make CH3NH2 more basic than (CH3)3N. The 2° compound is the most basic because of its higher inductive effect than primary amine and higher solvation than tertiary amine.\n"

        "Answer": "Answer: b\nExplanation: In ethyl substituted amines (aqueous), the inductive effect has a bigger role than the solvation effect (because the size of ethyl is larger than methyl group), and as a result the basic strength of N,N-diethylethanamine will be higher than that of ethanamine. Thus, the pKb value of the latter will be very slightly higher than the former.\n"
