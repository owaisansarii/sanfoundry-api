        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: a\nExplanation: Clay minerals are quite stable and are an important part of the soil. Clay minerals are also called as chemical sponges which basically hold water content and dissolved nutrients from other mineral particles. This results due to the presence of unstable electric charges on the surface of clay particles, in which opposite charges attract to each other."

The castings made have negligible porosity as compared to the castings made by die casting. So, the castings are of high strength in the vacuum die casting."

        "Answer": "Answer: a\nExplanation: In low-pressure die casting, compressed gas is basically used at a pressure typically ranging from 0.3 to 1.5 bars to force the molten metal to rise slowly through the ceramic riser tube that is connected to the mould. Pressure should be below atmospheric pressure to easily pull the molten metal into the cavity."
