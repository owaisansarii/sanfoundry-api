            "d) Covalent > Ionic > Hydrogen = Vanderwaal"
        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: b\nExplanation: Intramolecular bonds are called covalent bonds and are far stronger that intermolecular forces (or bonds). The latter are usually ranked as follows: ionic > Vanderwaal > hydrogen. Hydrogen bonding includes inter molecular interactions with permanent dipoles (and partial charges) between hydrogen atoms and a few other elements. Vander Waals interactions are based on random and instantaneous dipoles which last for fractions of a second in long, polarizable bonds."

        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: c\nExplanation: Polar molecules occur when two atoms do not share electrons equally in a covalent bond. A dipole is formed, with part of the molecule carrying a slight positive charge and the other part carrying a slight negative charge. This happens when there is a difference between the electronegativity of each atom. An extreme difference forms an ionic bond, while a lesser difference forms a polar covalent bond. When molecules share electrons equally in a covalent bond there is no net electrical charge across the molecule. In a nonpolar covalent bond, the electrons are evenly distributed."

            "d) Ribosomal S site"
        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: a\nExplanation: During translation, the aminoacyl tRNA carrying the desired amino acid approaches the A site on the ribosome. It then further moves to the P site and becomes peptidyl tRNA, which initiates the formation of a peptide bond between the amino acid and the growing peptide chain. The peptidyl tRNA leaves through the E site of ribosome."

        "Answer": "Answer: a\nExplanation: AvPI (Arabidopsis vacuola protein I) and AtNHX (Arabidosis transporting H+ ion) are the antiport proteins present on the membrane of vacuole. During salt stress condition, there is an increase in Na+ ion in the cell, which leads to acidity in cell and may be harmful to plants. These antiport transport Na+ ion into the vacuole from cytoplasm coupled with the transport of H+ ion from vacuole to cytoplasm. This result in reduction of Na+ concentration in cytoplasm and reduction of acidity in salt-stress condition."
