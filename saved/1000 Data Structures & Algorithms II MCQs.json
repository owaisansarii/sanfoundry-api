Therefore, for every element we compare the element with the internal nodes until we the leaves and then once again compare the element with its parent to decide whether it is right child or left child.

        "Options": [
            "a) its has low time complexity",
            "b) it has low space complexity",
            "c) it is easy to implement",
            "d) it requires only n swaps under any condition"
        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: d\nExplanation: Selection sort works by obtaining least value element in each iteration and then swapping it with the current index. So it will take n swaps under any condition which will be useful when memory write operation is expensive."

        "Question": "What will be the recurrence relation of the code of recursive selection sort?",
        "Options": [
            "a) T(n) = 2T(n/2) + n",

            "d) T(n) = T(n-1) + c"
        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: c\nExplanation: Function to find the minimum element index takes n time.The recursive call is made to one less element than in the previous call so the overall recurrence relation becomes T(n) = T(n-1) + n."

            "d) Merge sort"
        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: a\nExplanation: Out of the given options selection sort is the only algorithm which is not stable. It is because the order of identical elements in sorted output may be different from input array."

            "d) O(n log n)"
        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: b\nExplanation: Selection sort’s algorithm is such that it finds the index of minimum element in each iteration even if the given array is already sorted. Thus its best case time complexity becomes O(n2)."

            "d) O(log n)"
        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: a\nExplanation: In selection sort we need to compare elements in order to find the minimum element in each iteration. So we can say that it uses comparisons in order to sort the array. Thus it qualifies as a comparison based sort."

        "Answer": "Answer: b\nExplanation: Using the function recursiveSelectionSort() we find the element that needs to be placed at the current index. For finding the minimum element index we use another function minIndex(). After finding the minimum element index the current element is swapped with this element in the function recursiveSelectionSort()."

        "Options": [
            "a) You are given a bag that can carry a maximum weight of W. You are given N items which have a weight of {w1, w2, w3,…., wn} and a value of {v1, v2, v3,…., vn}. You can break the items into smaller pieces. Choose the items in such a way that you get the maximum value",
            "b) You are studying for an exam and you have to study N questions. The questions take {t1, t2, t3,…., tn} time(in hours) and carry {m1, m2, m3,…., mn} marks. You can study for a maximum of T hours. You can either study a question or leave it. Choose the questions in such a way that your score is maximized",
            "c) You are given infinite coins of denominations {v1, v2, v3,….., vn} and a sum S. You have to find the minimum number of coins required to get the sum S",
            "d) You are given a suitcase that can carry a maximum weight of 15kg. You are given 4 items which have a weight of {10, 20, 15,40} and a value of {1, 2, 3,4}. You can break the items into smaller pieces. Choose the items in such a way that you get the maximum value"
        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: b\nExplanation: In this case, questions are used instead of items. Each question has a score which is same as each item having a value. Also, each question takes a time t which is same as each item having a weight w. You have to maximize the score in time T which is same as maximizing the value using a bag of weight W."

The subset of items with the maximum value and a weight less than equal to the maximum allowed weight gives the answer. The time taken to calculate all the subsets is O(2n)."
