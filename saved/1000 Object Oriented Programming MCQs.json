            "d) OOP can be used without using any header file"
        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: b\nExplanation: In C++, it’s not necessary to use classes, and hence codes can be written without using OOP concept. Classes may or may not contain member functions, so it’s not a necessary condition in C++. And, an object can only be declared in a code if its class is defined/included via header file."

        "Answer": "Answer: a\nExplanation: It is possible to implement polymorphism in C language, even though it doesn’t support class. We can use structures and then declare pointers which in turn points to some function. In this way we simulate the functions like member functions but not exactly member function. Now we can overload these functions, hence implementing polymorphism in C language."

        "Answer": "Answer: a\nExplanation: Consider that a variable is private in base class and the derived class uses public inheritance to inherit that class. Now if we also have a global variable of same name as that of base class private variable, neither the global variable nor the base class private variable will be accessible from derived class. This is because we can’t have 2 variables with same name in same local scope. Hence the private members are accessible but not directly."

            "d) Not mandatory for all the derived classes"
        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: c\nExplanation: The derived classes must define the abstract function of base class in their own body. This is a necessary condition. Because the abstract functions doesn’t contain any definition in base class and hence becomes mandatory for the derived class to define them. All the functions in a program must have some definition."

        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: a\nExplanation: The upcasting is always safe since the derived type or the smaller type is converted into the base type or the larger size. This results in allocating a smaller size data into bigger type data. No data is lost in casting, hence safe."

            "d) Are not destroyed throughout the program execution"
        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: b\nExplanation: It is not necessary that the objects get destroyed when they go out of scope if allocated by using new operator. This is because new operator returns a pointer to object that it had allocated. A suitable pointer with proper scope should be defined by the programmer explicitly."
