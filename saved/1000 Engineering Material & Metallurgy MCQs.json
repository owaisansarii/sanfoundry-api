        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: a\nExplanation: Higher cobalt concentration of about 13-17% results in 30-40% faster wear or the alloys. However, it provides better resistance to mechanical shock. The basic tungsten-carbide composition containing 6-8% cobalt is recommended for general wear applications."

        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: a\nExplanation: Hard facings can be applied to most ferrous metals, but with a few exceptions. Carbon steels containing less than 0.35% carbon are relatively easy to hard-face. Welding becomes more difficult with increasing carbon content and hence must be preheated and postheated for hard-facing."

        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: a\nExplanation: The strengthening of an alloy resulting from the precipitation of a finely dispersed second phase from a supersaturated solid solution is called age hardening. The finely dispersed second phase precipitates with age. This type of hardening is known as age hardening."

        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: c\nExplanation: For age-hardening of alloys, it must be first solutionized by heating into a single phase region. Then the alloy must be rapidly quenched into the two-phase region. Lastly, fine-scale transition structure as small as 100 angstrom is formed due to aging above room temperature."
