        "Answer": "Answer: a\nExplanation: The stress-strain curve defines the relationship between force and elongation of any material. This curve can be divided into 2 major parts.\nFirst one is the linear part, which starts at the origin and extends up to the propositional limit. In this region, slope of the curve remains linear and constant. The slope of the curve is known as young modulus.\nThe second part is the non-linear part, which begins after the proportional limit point. The relational ship between stress and strain is non-linear in this region. Simple Hooke’s law will not be enough to define the nature of the curve.\n"

Eq. τm=G/2π; predicts that the theoretical shear stress will be in the range (3 to 30 GPa), while actual values of the shear stress required to produce plastic deformation in single metal crystals are in the range 0.5 to 10 MPa. This large difference in values is due to defects and dislocation present in real crystals.\n"

        "Answer": "Answer: a\nExplanation: The dislocation width is important because it determines the force required to move a dislocation through the crystal lattice. This force is called the Peierls-Nabarro force. The Peierls stress is the shear stress required to move a dislocation through a crystal lattice in a particular direction. Hearing Nabarro is a phenomenon in the creep. Drag force is associated with fluid mechanics. The frictional force is the resistance offered by the material on movement in contact with the other surface.\n"

        "Answer": "Answer: b\nExplanation: The phenomenon of cross slip is restricted to screw dislocations. Since the line of screw dislocation and its Burgers vector are parallel, this does not define a specific plane as with an edge dislocation (where b is perpendicular to the dislocation line). So, in edge dislocation, cross slip is not possible.\n"

So when two dislocations of the same sign on the same plane combines, they will create a region of higher compressive and tensile stress. This combination of two dislocations will result in an increase of free energy of the system. That is why they try to repel each other to minimize the energy of the system.\n"

        "Answer": "Answer: c\nExplanation: The dislocation creep is the movement of dislocation at high temperature. It is done in two-steps. First, the glide of dislocation on plane and second, when any obstacle comes, the dislocation climbs and moves to parallel or another plane. Hence, the climb is controlled by diffusion of atoms and diffusion is a slow process; hence, the diffusion of atoms becomes the rate-controlling step.\n"

        "Options": [
            "a) Wrap forming",
            "b) Rubber forming",
            "c) Spinning",
            "d) Wiper type bending"
        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: b\nExplanation: The rubber hydroforming is the method in which the rubber is used from one end of the die to uniformly transmit the load to sheet metal part. This prevents the wear of metal at the Sharpe bends. It is also known as Guerin process.\n"

        "Question": "For ductile material to cause shearing, the penetration of tool along the thickness should be _____ whereas for brittle material it is ________",
        "Options": [
            "a) high, low",

            "d) moderate, high"
        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: c\nExplanation: In the spinning operation, the sheet metal is rotated at very high speed and with machine tool or manually the sheet is deformed into the desired shape. It is used for making symmetric and circular objects.\n"

        "Question": "A steel sheet of thickness 25 mm is sheared with a knife, and the fracture length is 50 mm. Find the shear force required, if the tensile strength of steel is 250 MPa?",
        "Options": [
            "a) 500 kN",
            "b) 250 kN",
            "c) 218 kN",
            "d) 238 kN"
        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: a\nExplanation: In shearing process, the tool penetrated the sheet metal along its thickness; this causes the shearing and complete breaking of the sample. So, if the material is brittle on small penetration the material will shear off whereas on the ductile metal more considerable penetration will be required.\n"

        "Question": "If the minimum bend radius of the material is small, this indicates that the ________",
        "Options": [
            "a) Metal is highly ductile in nature",
            "b) Metal is highly brittle in nature",
            "c) Metal will easily crack on bending",
            "d) Metal will have high tensile strength"
        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: b\nExplanation: There is an optimum level of clearance which needs to be provided to get the smooth fractured surface. This depends upon the plane on which the fracture takes place concerning tool position. "

        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: c\nExplanation: When the material is deforming elastically, the neutral axis remains in the midline along the thickness, but when the material is deformed, the outer surface is plastically distorted in tensile stress, whereas the inner surface deforms in compression. So the neutral axis shifts below the mid-point line.\n"
