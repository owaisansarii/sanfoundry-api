        "Answer": "Answer: a\nExplanation: Bevel gear grinding improves all important properties such as strength, noise characteristics and efficiency. It also requires less investment and follows simple working principle. Lapping typically improves the wear properties of gear tooth, and corrects minute errors in involute profile, helix angle, tooth spacing and concentricity created in the forming, cutting or in the heat treatment of the gears. But the main disadvantage of lapping is that, it is a mating process; two gears that have been matched by lapping should be operated as a set and also replaced as a set, rather than singly."

            "d) post-cutting"
        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: d\nExplanation: The stock to be roll formed may be either pre-cut to a pre-determined length before roll forming, or post-cut afterward to a specified dimension. But the latter one is the most common. By incorporating auxiliary equipment such as pre-notching, punching, embossing, etc. the post-cut method can be a complete net-shape process, fully automated."

        "Answer": "Answer: c\nExplanation: In the pre-cut method, material passes through the rolls at fixed speeds of 50 to 250 feet per minute or 15 to 76 meters per minute. Pre-cut roll forming is commonly used for low production when nothing is required that cannot be easily done using post-cut lines, or when multiple profile widths require expensive and or time consuming tool changeover."

        "Options": [
            "a) When the material does not stress beyond its elastic limit",

            "d) When the material is too soft"
        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: a\nExplanation: Elastic limit is the point beyond which material deforms permanently under stress. Springback is the tendency to regain the initial shape. Therefore, it occurs when the material does not stress beyond its elastic limit during forming. Spring is often compensated by overforming the material and then allowing it to ‘spring back’ to the required profile."

            "d) vacuum"
        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: a\nExplanation: During the first half cycle the powder in the chamber is forced out of the nozzle. At this point, the reservoir is still pressurized, but the mixing chamber is at atmospheric pressure due to the open nozzle. This creates a pressure differential that forces the powder down through the orifice at the bottom of the reservoir and into the mixing chamber."

Hence, quite often stabilisers (long chain polymers) that hinder the fragmentation of water jet are added to the water."

The wire ED machine is one of the most accurate machines in mould shops and usually there is also free machining time available. Another option is to cut and shape the ejectors in a milling machine, but the most accurate milling machines are used in mould cavity machining operations and normally they are rather busy for long periods of time."

        "Answer": "Answer: c\nExplanation: At high power densities all materials will evaporate if the energy can be absorbed. Thus, when welding in this way a hole is usually formed by evaporation. This “hole” is then traversed through the material with the molten walls sealing up behind it. The result is what is known as a “keyhole weld. This is characterized by its parallel sided fusion zone and narrow width."

        "Answer": "Answer: a\nExplanation: It is due to the shrinkage stress building up before the weld is fully solidified and strong enough to take the stress. It usually happens in metal alloys having a wide temperature range over which solidification occurs, e.g. those with high C, S, and P contents."

The stored energy increases with increasing deformation, but at a decreasing rate, so that the fraction of the total energy stored decreases with increasing deformation."

        "Answer": "Answer: a\nExplanation: ΔG = ΔH – T ΔS, this equation is known as Gibb’s free energy equation. While plastic deformation certainly increases the entropy of a metal, the effect is small compared to the increase in internal energy (the retained strain energy). The term T∆S in the free energy equation may be neglected and the free-energy increase equated directly to the stored energy. Where  ∆G is the free energy associated with the cold work, ∆H is the enthalpy or stored strain energy, ∆S is the entropy increase due to the cold work, and T is the absolute temperature."

        "Answer": "Answer: c\nExplanation: Decreasing the grain size increases the grain-boundary area and, as a consequence, the volume and uniformity of distorted metal (that adjacent to the boundaries). This effect increases the number of possible sites of nucleation and, therefore, the smaller the grains of the metal before cold work, the greater will be the rate of nucleation and the smaller the recrystallized grain size for a given degree of deformation."

        "Options": [
            "a) drilling action",
            "b) melting action",
            "c) shearing acting",
            "d) using brittleness of the material"
        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: c\nExplanation: There are different machining processes, such as turning, milling, boring etc. In all these cases metal is removed by a shearing process, which occurs due to the relative motion between the workpiece and the tool. Generally, one of the two rotates at designated and generally high speed, causing the shearing of material (known as chips), from the workpiece. The other moves relatively slowly to effect removal of metal throughout the workpiece."

        "Question": "The depth that the tool is plunged into the surface is called as ______",
        "Options": [
            "a) feed",
            "b) depth of cut",
            "c) depth of tool",
            "d) working depth"
        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: b\nExplanation: The depth of cut, DOC is the depth that the tool is plunged into the surface. Feed defines the relative lateral movement between the cutting tool and the workpiece. Thus, together with the depth of cut, feed decides the cross section of the material removed for every rotation of the job or the tool."

        "Options": [
            "a) length/revolution",
            "b) degree/revolution",
            "c) length",
            "d) velocity"
        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: a\nExplanation: Feed is the amount of material removed for each revolution or per pass of the tool over the workpiece and is measured in units of length/revolution, length/pass or other appropriate units for the particular process. "

        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: a\nExplanation: In CNC systems multiple microprocessors and programmable logic controllers work in parallel for simultaneous servo position and velocity control of several axes of a machine for contour cutting as well as monitoring of the cutting process and the machine tool."

        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: b\nExplanation: CNC machine tool systems can be classified in various ways such as:\n•\tPoint-to-point or contouring: depending on whether the machine cuts metal while the workpiece moves relative to the tool\n•\tIncremental or absolute: depending on the type of coordinate system adopted to parameterise the motion commands\n•\tOpen-loop or closed-loop: depending on the control system adopted for axis motion control."

        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: a\nExplanation: Such systems are used, typically, to perform hole operations such as drilling, boring, reaming, tapping and punching. In a PTP system, the path of the cutting tool and its feed rate while traveling from one point to the next are not significant, since, the tool is not cutting while there is motion."
