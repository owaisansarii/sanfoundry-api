        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: c\nExplanation: Spray and Tray type is a Direct Contact Type heat exchanger which involves the transfer of heat between two immiscible fluids by bringing them into contact at different temperatures. Spray and Tray type heat exchanger involves spraying of liquid in a chamber with cold air, hence it is in direct contact with air."

        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: c\nExplanation: In a Storage Type Heat Exchanger, the heat energy from the hot fluid is first stored in the matrix/wall of the heat exchanger. Wherein, cooling of the hot fluid takes place. As the cold fluid passes through this same matrix later, the stored heat energy in the matrix is transferred to the cold fluid. This intermittent flow pattern of hot fluid and cold fluid is an exclusive property of Storage Type HE."

        "Answer": "Answer: b\nExplanation: Under Fluidisation condition, the pressure drop of the fluid through the pellet-bed remains almost constant, which is independent of the fluid flow rate leading to a strong mixing of the solid particles/ pellets. This results in a uniform temperature for the total bed."

        "Answer": "Answer: c\nExplanation: Fins are generally used to increase the Heat transfer Area when the heat transfer coefficient on that fluid side is comparatively low. Hence as gases usually have lower heat transfer coefficients, fins are kept on this side. Also baffles are provided to give support to the tubes and increase the turbulence of the fluid in shell side."
