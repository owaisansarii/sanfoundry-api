        "Answer": "Answer: a\nExplanation: Though the VAR system has many advantages over VCR, VAR gives lower C.O.P. as compared to VCR. Compressor used in the VCR system given higher pressure difference, which increases the temperature more and thus increasing the heat rejection. Overall impacting the C.O.P. to increase but in case of VAR system, heat supplied is limited so overall C.O.P. is not as high as in the VCR."

        "Answer": "Answer: d\nExplanation: The ammonia is used as a refrigerant because it possesses most of the desirable properties. It is toxic, but due to the absence of moving parts, there is very little chance for leakage and the total amount used is also small. The hydrogen, being the lightest gas, is used to increase the rate of evaporation of the liquid ammonia passing through the evaporator."

The more the C.O.P., more the refrigeration effect is produced, and lower temperatures can be achieved. Among the given options, Carbon dioxide is having least C.O.P. for given temperatures conditions, which is valued at 2.56.
