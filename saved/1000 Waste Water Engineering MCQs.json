            "d)\tNickel"
        ],
        "Answer": "Answer: c\nExplanation: There are other cathodic reactions and additives that suppress these reactions called cathodic inhibitors. They function by reducing the available area for the cathodic reaction. This is often achieved by precipitating an insoluble species onto the cathodic sites. Zinc ions are used as cathodic inhibitors because of the precipitation of Zn(OH)2 at cathodic sites as a consequence of the localised high pH."
