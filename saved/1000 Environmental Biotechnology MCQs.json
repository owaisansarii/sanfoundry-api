        "Answer": "Answer: c\nExplanation: Methane formation or methanogenesis is a process in anaerobic fermentation. Hydrolysis converts organic matter, Acidification forms acetic acid and methanogenesis leads to methane. Since, this is an end product, it doesn’t raise the technical expenditure. Whereas, Noise, germs, odor and dust can elevate the growth of technical expenditure if their emissions are not controlled.\n"

        "Answer": "Answer: d\nExplanation: Anaerobic digestion is the step where the phosphorus is released which is further harvested for phosphorus. In this step phosphorus rich solids are found. Bioleaching is the extraction of metals using microbes and ash is the by-product of incineration, which is a step where the effluent is burnt under very high temperature.  The ash also contains parts of phosphorus but phosphorus is not released in this step.\n"

        "Answer": "Answer: b\nExplanation: Thioether oxidation, usually performed by microbial population by oxidizing the Sulphur present in the pesticides. Heavy metals are not pesticides and they definitely can affect the microbial population in the habitat as they have the potential to degrade the organisms present in the environment. Green algae and oxygen are the compounds that are not harmful to the microbial population or the environment and it not a process that would help in degradation of pesticides using microbial population.\n"
