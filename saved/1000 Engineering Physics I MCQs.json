Third law is contained in the second law: In the absence of external force, the rate of change of momentum must be zero. This is the third law of motion. As both first and second law are confined in the second law, it the real law of motion."

The greater the moment of inertia of body, the greater is the torque required to change its state of rotation. Thus moment of inertia of a body can be regarded as the measure of the rotational inertia of the body."
